this in his having appointed Vestinus
to the superintendence of the works,
and from this single sentence it
might naturally seem that Vespasian
made the appointment personally,
not by message. But Tacitus recurs
in c. 68 to the supremacy of Muci-
anus and Domitian at Rome, and
in 81 sqq. tothe events ofVespasian's
sojourn at Alexandria. Having at
least three threads of narrative in
hand (events at Rome, in Germany,
and in the East), it is perhaps not
surprising that he sometimes in-
advertently, as sometimes know-
ingly, follows one a little way and
has to return to gather up the rest.

Equestris ordinis virum] Identi-
fied with Vestinus os Vienna, whom
Claudius, in his speech (of which
we have Tacitus' version in Anu.
xi. 24) on the grant of the right of
honours to the Gauls, calls equestris
ordinis ornamentmn.

in paludes] The marshes of Ostia
were the general receptacle of rub-
bish ; so in Ann. xv. 43. 4 we hear
of them as receiving the ruins of the
Neronian conflagration. But here
the sense is, that the hallowed
stones are to be put out of the way,
not profaned by application to any
fresh use.

2 quis fausta nomina] With
names whose etymological meaning
was of good omen: ‘talia sunt
Salvius, Longinus, Statorius, Vale·-
rius‚' Lips. Compare Cic. de Div.
i. 45. 102, etc.

felicibus ramis] Not in the
general sense of ‘ fruitsul,' in which
the epithet seems to be used in
poetry, but in a technical ritual
meaning (Macrob. ii. 16, iii. 30),
acceptable to the gods of heaven.
Laurel, myrtle, beech, and the
various kinds of oak, though the
former at least could not be called
fruit-bearing trees, were filices. Con-
trast the z'nfdix arbor on which
criminals were to be hung, Liv. i.
26.

patrimis matrimisque] Strictly,
according to Servius on Gemg. i.
31, not only having both parents
living, but born in confarreate mar-
riage. Such marriages had now
become very rare, Ann. iv. 16. 2;
there is some support sor the view,
that the condition was treated only
as requiring that they should be of
patrician birth, and that children
of senators, who had both parents
living, were assumed to be eligible.
But the Emperors made efforts from
time to time to revive confarrea—
tion, and with the extension of the
Patriciate may have attained suffi-
cient success to secure their object,
the qualification of a few men, -
women, and children for certain
religious services

aqua e fontibus] Tw‘mis, in-
serted in M.‚ is a manifest διττογρα-
φία srom the epithets just above : it
seems therefore better to omit it
altogether than to correct it into
vevzs.
