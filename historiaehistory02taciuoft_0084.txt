72 CORNELII TACITI

Jovi Custodi templum ingens seque in sinu dei sacravit.
Sabinus et Atticus, onerati catenis et ad Vitellium ducti,3
nequaquam infesto sermone voltuque excipiuntur, frementibus
qui jus caedis et praemia enavatae operae petebant. Clamore
a proximis orto, sordida pars plebis supplicium Sabini expos-

cit, minas adulationesque miscet.
