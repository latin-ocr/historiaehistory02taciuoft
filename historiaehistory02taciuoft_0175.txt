HISTORIARUM IV. 76. 161

Cerialis Civili et Classico nihil: eum qui attulerat, ipsas
epistolas, ad Domitianum misit. Hostes, divisis copiis,

words are right ; but the asyndeton
is harsh, and editors are tempted
to read et ipsas.

ad D. misit probably implies
that he did not ‘recognise the
rebels as belligerents,’ so as to be
bound by the laws of war to
respect their envoy; it may, how-
