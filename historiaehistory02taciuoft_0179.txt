son (63. 2) had rejoined his father.
The surrender of the hostages ap-
pears prima facie treacherous‚ but
perhaps we may inser that German
honour did not condemn it, corn-
paring Segestes' surrender of his
daughter, the wife of Arminius, in
Ann. i. 57 sq. But justae preces
in the next ὅ suggests that Tacitus
was quite willing to excuse, and
Cerialis no doubt to accept, any
treachery committed in the interests
of Rome ; theirs was anyhow gross
enough.

3 flagrantissima] Rarely used of
persons absolutely, without an abl.
expressing the enflaming cause.

e Chaucis Frisiisque] Civilis has
organised a cohort (not a mere
caterva) of his northern neighbours,
who have come to some extent

under Roman influence through the
Batavians. The Bructeri and T enc-
teri fight independently, but the
Chauci, beyond these to the north-
east‚ come in smaller numbers, and
so he seels able to embody thern in
the corps he hopes to make most
efficient.

4 foribus] Of their quarters or
barrack, where the feast took place.

5 terrestri itinere] Presumably
by the military road still traceable
from Boulogne to Tongres.

in deditionem] Having been
gained over by Civilis, 66. 3.

6 ultro] Not ‘without orders
from Civilis‚⁷ but ‘ without waiting
sor the Romans to attack them.'
They had joined the insurrection
from the first, and had a commander
of their own, 15. 2.
