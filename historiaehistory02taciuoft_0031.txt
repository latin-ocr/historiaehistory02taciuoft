happened to Romans, except in
civil wars and in that with Hanni-
ba1; cf. Virg. G‘mgr. i. 4. 89,
paribus conczcrrere telis.

crebris . . . signum] So Thuc.
vii. 44. 5, of another night battle.

5 primipili centurio] It appears
to have been part of his official duty
to take charge of the eagle; the
aquilffer only carried it on the
march.

arma] As never

CH. XXIII. 1 labantem] M.
has labentem, which some defend,
comparing Cic. Rab. Post. 16. 43,
Plu'l. ii. 21. 51.

praetorianis] Who were on the
extreme right, perhaps clear of the
enemy’s line, but unable to turn
their flank in the darkness and
broken ground.

2 vacuo atque aperto] Or. calls
these ablatives absolute3 they are
almost as like the local ablatives in
19. 3, 38. 25 in fact they have come
to be very nearly adverbs. We
may translate—‘with an open and

uninterrupted rangcj' the engines

on the road would command the
limes (shooting over the vineyards
in the angle between) on one side,
and the open plain on the other.
quintae decimae] M. has quartae
dccx, and though that legion had
been sent to Britain (ii. 66. 7), and,
moreover, was hostile to Vitellius,
it is certainly possible that its engines
may have been left behind. But
the 15th was actually present, in or

about the middle of the Vitellian

line, so that there is little doubt of
the emendation.

3 intulissent] The tormenta gene-
rally, not the saxa from the one
ballista.

scutis] Belonging to slain Vitel-
lian soldiers, and having Vitellius'
name on them. See on ii. 85. 2.

libramenta] Not (as sometimes
explained) ‘weights' to keep the
machine steady and lessen the recoil,
but the ‘springs' of twisted rope,
the tension of which furnished the
propelling power. The vincla may
form a hendiadys with libra, or may
mean the rope joining the two free
