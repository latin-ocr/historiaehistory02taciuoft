5 Cerialem delegerat] According
to Josephus, Cerialis was not select-
ed by Mucianus nor (sor this com-
mand especially) by Vespasiam but
arrived opportunely on his way
towards Britain, where Vespasian
had named him to the command,
and where he had, some years
before, already served with credit.
According to the same authority,
he was now consul—Vespasian and
'situs having no doubt held office
sor the usual term of two months.

2. 1, 39. 2, 51. 3. Seli-pleasihg in
one ‹lirection was thought to iruply
sels-will in another—just as Alcibia-
des’ irreligion and iinmorality was

held to prove him to be politically
dangerous.

uti dminus] 39. 3.

3 domul . . . innexum] Per-
haps Sabinus had married his
sister; Sabinus' younger son bore the
cognomen Clemens. See on i. 14. 2.

grauissimum D.] Domitian how-
ever, when emperor, put him to
death, as well as his two (presumed)
nephews.

quamquam Senatorfl ordinls]
Suetonius asserts, that Titus was
the first praejectus praetorio of more
than equestrian rank. He is no
doubt wrong.

sufficere] This passage shows
that the custom os intrusting the
ossice to equites was not merely due
tojealousy—it seemed in aecordance
with the titness of things.

4 adsumuntur] ⁴ Are chosen as
companions' to Mucianus, whose
purpose of going in person to Gaul
was implied in ς’ 1.
