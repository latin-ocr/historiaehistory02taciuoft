HISTORIARUM FRAGMENTA. 219

made a collection of miscellaneous good jokes, including Cicero's⁷
Judging from the specimens preserved of Cicero's Apophllzegmata‚ we
should imagine that Tacitus' facetiae were conversational mols, or at most
brilliant passages in his speeches, not extracts from his published works.
Nevertheless, the style and narrative character of the sentence makes it
probable that it comes from a lost part of the Histories or Annals: ‘ And
so they were slain, leaving behind in their sons an epitaph on their
departed virtues‚’ is not too harsh a phrase nor too sarcastic a sentiment
to have occurred in either. We append it, therefore, to the Historia, as
possibly, though not certainly, belonging to them.
