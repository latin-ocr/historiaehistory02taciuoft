velut jus necis vitaeque civium, reddebat. Aspernante con· 4
sule, reclamantibus qui in contione adstiterant, ut in aede
Concordiae positurus insignia imperii, domumque fratris peti-
turus discessit. Major hic clamor obsistentium penatibuSS
privatis, in Palatium vocantium. Interclusum aliud iter,
idque solum quod in Sacram viam pergeret patebat.
consilii inops in Palatium rediit. Praevenerat rumor ejurari 6
ab eo imperium, scripseratque Flavius Sabinus cohortium
59 tribunis ut militem cohiberent. Igitur tamquam omnis res-
publica in Vespasiani sinum cessisset, primores senatus et
plerique equestris ordinis omnisque miles urbanus et vigiles
domum Flavii Sabini complevere. Illuc de studiis volgi et

minis Germanicarum cohortium adfertur.

to Vitellius, makinghim more earnest
in his offer to resign and less passive
in his revocation of it. He says
that on the refusal of the dagger by
the consul, he offered it to the other
magistrates and the senators in turn3
when all refused, he said he would
dedicate it in the Temple ofConcord3
they cried ‘he was Concord himself‚'
and he answered that he would
accept the title (cf. L. Antonius
Pietas) and retain the token of
power.

5 in Sacram vlam] Leading from
the Forum (he had spoken on the
Rostra, 70. 2) to the Palatine.

6 cohiberent] More than ‘keep
in order ;’ he l-:new that they would

not submit to the abdication with· Α

out positive ‘ restraint.'
CH. LXIX. 1 in V. sinum] As
we should say, ‘into his arms;’

Germanicarum cohortium]
Thirty-four had entered the city with
Vitellius (ii. 89. 2), some, but pro-
bably not many, had marched with
Caecina (ii. 100. Ι) ; and three had
been sent to Valens 3 probably there
were still several thousand men, in
spite of 64. 2, 78. 4.

2 disjectos . . . consectarentur]
If Sabinus did not assemble an
armed force in Rome, the only
safety for individuals who had com⁴
mitted themselves was to fly to the
army. The wisest course, Tac.
thinks (ξ 9), would have been to
withdraw armed and in a body, but
he here explains why men were
afraid to withdraw otherwise.

3 periculum pauci sumpsere] If
some took up armS, those who did
not could hardly be attacked.
