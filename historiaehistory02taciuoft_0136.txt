ward, os judicial advocacy; under
the empire it [ended to sall into the
hands of a profession in the modern
sense, with professional reputation

necessary to repeat the words os it,
and those who could not take the
oath with truth as it stood tried to
vary the words, as if by lapse of

and professional emoluments. But
there had hardly been time, ,and
had not been favourable circum-
stance5‚ sor the growth of a profes-
sional code os honour, while it was
expected os a professed philosopher
that he ⁴should rise above the con·
ventional standard os his order.

6 principem] Notice the opposi-
tion 1ο Caesare.

CH. XLI. tnchoantabus prim-
oribus] Those first asked sor their
sententia not only proposed the sorm
of the oath‚ but took it loco scn-
tentiae ,· they were followed by the
magistrates (the primores would be
passed magistrates, in sact consulars),
and the rest of the senators in order.

verba . . . mutantibus] In the
case osan ordinary sententia, it would
have been enough to say, ‘ Quibus
de rcbus rqfi‘rs P. Helvidio assenlio,'
but in taking a solemn oath, it was

mernory, into something that they
could swear to without direct false-
hood. But (3' 2) the assembly told
them that it was a sign of grace to
try to avoid perjury, but they had
not sueceeded even so.

2 anue velut: censura] ‘This
quasi censorship‚'—-noting of un-
worthy names on the senatorial
roll. There had been no real cen-
sura since that of Claudius and the
elder Vitellius.

3 manus tuventaro] So Ann. i.
27. 1. No doubt literally ‘shaking
their fists at him,’ as Or. l.c., but
here he accepts the view that waters
it down into minari se manus illa-
turos.

transgressi] Alsoliterally, ‘walk-
ing across the house to him.’

scribentes] Ann. xiii. 48. 3.
We have not Tacitus' account of
their death, which took place while
