8 CORNELII TACITI

postquam Galbae imagines discordia temporum subversas in
omnibus municipiis recoli jussit Antonius, decorum pro causa
ratus, si placere Galbae principatus et partes revirescere

8 crederentur.

Quaesitum inde quae sedes bello legeretur.

Verona potior visa„ patentibus circum campis ad pugnam
equestrem, qua praevalebant: simul coloniam copiis validam

auferre Vitellio, in rem famamque videbatur.

boast.’ M. has gloriaeque majus,
whence Bekker read gloriae in
majus most others as in text.

recoll] To be replaced in their
old honourable—one might say
sacred—position.

partes reim-escere] That it was
Galba's party reviving, not a new
one starting.

Cu. VIII. 1 potior] Than
Aquileia, which was (ἓ 3) practi-
cally the alternative; is there had
been more than two courses open,
potissima would have been required.

qua praevalebant] Rather ‘in
which their chief strength lay ’ than
‘ in which they were stronger ' than
the enemy. They had (2. 7) sewer
legions than the enemy, probably
sewer legionaries, and, it appears,
sewer soldiers on the whole, but not
by very much ; still it was the mis-
cellanec ons cohortes alaeque that re-
dressed, but did not destroy, the
inequality.

2 parum] Though an adv„ not
an adj„ like its opposite satis has
enough independence to stand as a

predicate; and Tac. thinks that, as
he might have said quod cum per se
parum esset just as well as quod cum
per se parvum esset, so he might put
quod per se parum, as though parum
were an ad'. agreeing with quod.

pretium} Used absol. in the sense
in which operaepretium is commonet ;
so Ann. i. 57. 4, ii. 351.

3 Et interjectus . . . obsepseratj
The first words in M. run, et inter-
tectus exercitus filiam, the abbrevia·
tion in the last standing sorpraetiam.
For this per Raetiam is no doubt
the facilior lectio, but the simple
Raetiam has the recommendation
of difficilior interpretatio, and yet
suits the sense better when once
understood. At Verona the army
blocked Raetia and the passes north
and east of thern, which both cut off
the Vitellian troops in Raetia itself,
and prevented its being a thorough—
sare sor the Vitellian troops beyond
it. lnterjectus is certainly right,
though the old copies have inter-
ce lus.

{iubebat} He at this very time
