210 CORNELII TACITI

que Civilis intactas nota arte ducum sinebat, cum interim
flexu auctumni et crebris per aequinoctium imbribus super-
fusus amnis palustrem humilemque insulam in faciem stagni
opplevit. Nec classis aut commeatus aderant, castraque in
plano sita vi fluminis differebantur. Potuisse tunc opprimi
legiones, et voluisse Germanos, sed dolo a se flexos inputavit
Civilis. Neque abhorret vero, quando paucis post diebus
‹leditio insecuta est. Nam Cerialis, per occultos nuntios
Batavis pacem, Civili veniam ostentans, Veledam propinquos-
que monebat fortunam belli, tot cladibus adversam, opportuno
erga populum Romanum merito mutare. Caesos Treveros,
receptos Ubios, ereptam Batavis patriam; neque aliud Civilis

turning his own right, and aster
this he sclt his position untenable.

nota arte ducum] Thuc. ii. 13.
1, Liv. ii. 39. 6, xxii. 23, etc.

flexu auctumni] ‘ As the autumn
was more than half through its
course ;' ‘ metaphora a flexu mctaess
Duebn. ap. Or.

per aequinoctium] Made out by
(η’. from the obscure and imperfect
letters in M.

classis aut commeatus] The
sseet ought, aster srightening Civilis
out οἵ the island, and disconcerting
his plan against the Roman com-
munications with Gaul, to have
resumed their own communication
with the land army. Instead, we
are to suppose that they turned
‹lown the Gaulish coast, leaving
the army to shift sor itself.

differebantur] ‘Began to be
carried away.’

Cn. XXIV. Neque abhorret
vero] It was likely enough that
the Germans wished to attack, and
that Civilis, already thinking os
surrender, restrained them. So

sar as we can tell, it is far less
likely that an attack, if made now,
had a better prospect of success
than former ones; but Tacitus
seems to imply that also.

2 Batavis . . . clvffl . . . Vele-
dam] Cerialis is not charged with
perfidy, nor even insincerity, in his
negotiations 3 only he had two
strings (or perhaps three) to his
bow. He might get Civilis to
submit (as he did); he might get
the Batavians to revolt from him
(as he nearly did); or again, he
might get Veleda to order Civilis
to be surrendered, which is meant
by opporlunum erga p. R. meritum.
Evcn if the war went on, he might
thus sow distrust among the con-
sederates ; but, if either of the
three parties came to terms, he
was not pledged to any other.

3 partum] A correction (as in
10. 3) sorparatum. Here the latter,
in the sense of ‘eamed,' seems not
impossible.
