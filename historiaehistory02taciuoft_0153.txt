the tribe constituted into the civitas
Agrippinensium.

4 capi] The storming of the Cap-
itol by the Vitellians, and ofthe city
by the Flavians are probably both
meant : hence the present, ‘ the
city is constantly being captured.’

distineri] Not to be altered to
detin. .· all the armies, each having
its own war on its hands (that just
ended in Italy against Vitellius, the
supposed one on the Danube, the
elements of one in Pontus, and the
actual one in Judaea) were not only
kept occupied, but kept apart.

dispecturaS, or disceptaturas .·
both readings are older than M.:
that of the text is the most natural.

CH. LVI. Adliciendos . . .
societatem] They had given signs
that they were not unwilling, 54.

Ea prinu· consilii forma] ‘ This

was the outline of their original
plan,' C. and B. But M. has con-
cilii,· which must mean, ‘this was
the purport of the first meeting' of
the Gallie Empire—treating the
hole-and-corner conspiracy as a
national assembly, by way of a
sneer at the nation.

3 Simulatum . . . opprimerent]
It is only fair to Classicus and his
associates to reniember that Ar-
minius had to display quite equal
treachery towards Varus, to estab-
lish the position of a national hero,
which he has held sor eighteen
centuries and a half, and which
Tacitus himself allows to him.

infrequentibus] Skeleton bat-
talions‚ 14. 5.

4 isdem, quibus petebatur] No
