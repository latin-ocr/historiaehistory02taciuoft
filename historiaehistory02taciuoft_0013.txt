perfidiae locum] As his first in-
stinct had been to desert the army,
it seemed that his deliberate purpose
in returning to it must have been
to betray it, not to serve in it3 but,
says Tac.‚ he really had no purpose
more deliberate than r‘estless vanity.

3 discrimini exemptum] The
revolt of the army had not been
due to him (ii. 86. 4), but it is signi-
ficant of the state of discipline, that
no one should have suspected that
lt was.

non quia . . . egebat] He would
have been hard up if he had been
dependent for energy on a man
natura ac senecta cunctatior.

consulare . . . praetenderetur]
‘ But in order that the name of a con—
sular might cover the revolt at its
most critical moment with a show
of honourable character.‘ Surgenti-
bus (as well as partibus, see on i. 13.
10) seems to indicate, not the rising
party only, but the revolutionum,-

the sentence, must be taken with

can be translated as above, if taken
to emphasise, so to speak‚ the tense
of the present partie. rather than its
root. If this be inadmissible, the
sense must be ‘that the party of
movement in particular [as that
most in want of something to give
it respectability], might secure the
cover of,’ etc.

2 exponerentur] This sense and
construction of the word is not com·
mon, and apparently post-Augustam.

3 Externa molirentur] ‘ Raise
foreign disturbances '——when armed
and broken in to fighting, begin
fighting on their own account 3 cf. i.
2. 2. The second dread (aut . . .
exuerent) is, that they might desert
to Vitellius, which the Flavian party
are, not without some irony, repre—
sented as conceiving to be worse
treason than revolting from Rome
altogether.

Italicus] A namesake, and so per-
haps a relation, of the Cheruscan
king ofAnn. xi. 16 sq.
