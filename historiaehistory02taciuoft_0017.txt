HISTORIARUM ΙΙΙ, 9. 9

consilium, quando Aegyptus, claustra annonae, vectigalia
opulentissimarum provinciarum obtinerentur, posse Vitellii
exercitum egestate stipendii frumentique ad deditionem subigi.
Eadem Mucianus crebris epistolis monebat, incruentam et 4
sine luctu victoriam et alia hujuscemodi praetexendo, sed

gloriae avidus atque omne belli decus sibi retinens.

Ceterum

ex distantibus terrarum spatiis consilia post res adferebantur.
9 Igitur repentino incursu Antonius stationes hostium inrupit,
tentatisque levi praelio animis ex aequo discessum. Mox 2
Caecina inter Hostiliam, vicum Veronensium, et paludes
Tartari fluminis castra permuniit, tutus loco, cum terga

flumine, latera objectu paludis tegerentur.

Quodsi adfuisset

fides, aut opprimi universis Vitellianorum viribus duae legiones,
nondum conjuncto Moesico exercitu, potuere, aut, retro actae,

deserta Italia, turpem fugam conscivissent.

Sed Caecina per 3

varias moras prima hostibus prodidit tempora belli, dum quos
armis pellere promptum erat, epistolis increpat, donec per

nuntios pacta perfidiae firmaret.

was despatching orders ; the an-
tithesis, {gnara aut vetita, is—‘ He
did not know of them, perhaps had
forbidden them, at the time they
were done.' Tac. does not mean
that he had given standing orders
before the troops moved at all, still
less (as appears from the end of this
chap.), that Vespasian's generals
ventured to disregard his expressed
directions.

Aegyptus . . . vectigalia] So
sar as sense goes, claustra annonae
would doubtless be in apposition
with Atgffitus ; but the transition
from apposition to asyndeton is too
harsh to have been consciously in-
tended by Tac. Rather, he gives us
a δύο διὰ τριῶν, in the sense in which
one talks of ἓν διὰ δυοῖν.

4 sed] Introduces his real motive,
and so is put as an antithesis to the
pretext. But sometimes (eng. Plaut.

Interim Aponius Saturninus 4

Aul. 3. 6. 37, sz't'era l., Juv. iii. 132,
iv. 27), sed seems to have rather an
illative than an adversative force,
like our ‘but then,' or even ‘but
also 3' and here we might hesitate
whether ‘but really' or ‘but also'
were the better equivalent of the
writer's meaning.

CH. IX. 1 tentatis . . . animis]
‘Their feelings,’ i.e. of loyalty‚ not
their daring.

the defences,' which on three sides
were provided by nature, or else
tulus loco will be a reason, not for,
but against, his conduct—‘went on
carefully with fortifications ’ that
were not needed, instead of striking
a decisive blow.
