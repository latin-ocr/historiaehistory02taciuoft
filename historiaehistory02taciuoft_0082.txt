the civil war at the time of the
buming has been mentioned. Or
there may be an allusion to his
previous victories in the war with
Mithridates ; Pliny tells us that the
columns employed in it were
brought by him from the temple of
Olympian Zeus at Athens.

hoc . . . negatum] Almost a
verbal transcript from Pliny (H. N.
vii. 43. 44). Of course the allu-
sion is to his sels-chosen surname,
Felix.

usque ad Vitemum] Yet Dio
tells us that Catulus' name was
erased by order os Caesar, and his
own substituted. Tacitus here

to reconcile them. Martial‚ v. 10.
6, throws no light upon the subject;
the probable reading is, Catuli vilia
templa, not Julia, and even the
latter would naturally be under-
stood in Tacitus' sense, that the
name os Catulus was lest amid the
work of the Caesars.

tot] M. has ta, which Or. says

argument that tanta ¹would not
meet the sense.

cremabatur] Returning to the
narrative from his digression ; ‘ this
was the temple that was now on
fire.’ Hence in the next α,

CH. LXXIII. 1 Sed is not
merely resumptive; the thought is,
‘all Romans ought to have looked
on such a conflagration with patriotic
horror3 now it was a matter of
indifference to the besiegers, os
selfish dread to the besieged.'

bant Both seem to be suggested
by Sall. Hist. i. c. 8, Fr. 95, neque

more clearly explained by the
next; it is not that the talker (75.

said nothing to the purpose, and
did not attend to those who did. ‘¹
