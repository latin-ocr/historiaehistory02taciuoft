6 CORNELII TACITI

reges Suevorum, quis vetus obsequium erga Romanos, et gens
fidei commissae patientior. Posita in latus auxilia, infesta
Raetia, cui Porcius Septiminus procurator erat, incorruptae
erga Vitellium fidei. Igitur Sextilius Felix, cum ala AurianaS
et octo cohortibus ac Noricorum juventute, ad occupandam
ripam Aeni fluminis, quod Raetos Noricosque interfluit,
missus. Nec his aut illis praelium tentantibus, fortuna 6
partium alibi transacta.

Ov. Tr. iv. 3. 14 z ‘ Deque fide
certa sit tibi certa fides‚' ‘ Have thou
sure saith in her sure faithfulness’
Here it would be harder to use iden-
tical or even cognate words, but the
sense seems to be—‘ more patient
under the obligation of allegiance to
Rome, because they were trusted by
Rome ;' thefides os which the nation
was patientior being different from
that which was commissa. Perhaps
‘ more tolerant of allegiance, because
it rested on confidence,' would ex-
press the sense. It seems impossible
to make patientior mean ‘more saith-
sul to trust reposed in them‚‘ but is
a little modifimtion of the common
sense os fides commissa may be
allowed, a better and simpler trans-
lation would be, ‘less restless under
a sense os having pledged their faith’
and parted with their freedom of
action. The comparison suggested
by patientior is probably any way
with what the Iazyges were, rather

than with what the Suevi would
have been, but for their honourable

relations with Rome.

How did the Suevi effect their junc-

while Raetia lay between ?

while his past justified the belief
that he was a good soldier, no one
believed him a good man.
