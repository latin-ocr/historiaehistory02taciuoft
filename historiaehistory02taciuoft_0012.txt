4 CORNELII TACITI

oculis, truci voce, quo latius audiretur (etenim se centuriones
et quidam militum consilio miscuerant,) ita effudit ut cautos

quoque ac providos permoveret, volgus et ceteri unum virum

ducemque, spreta aliorum segnitia, laudibus ferrent.

Hanc ²

sui samam ea statim contione commoverat, qua, recitatis

Vespasiani epistolis, non ut plerique incerta disseruit, huc

illuc tracturus interpretatione, prout conduxisset : aperte
descendisse in causam videbatur, eoque gratior militibus erat,
4 culpae vel gloriae socius. Proxima Cornelii Fusci procuratoris
auctoritas. Is quoque, inclementer in Vitellium invehi solitus,

nihil spei sibi inter adversa reliquerat.

T. Ampius Flavianus,

natura ac senecta cunctatior, suspiciones militum inritabat,
tamquam adfinitatis cum Vitellio meminisset3 idemque quod,

cleared sor our operations. The
text is easy enough, being paralleled
by Cic. Phil. vii. 1. 2, reserare nos
cxlcris genliltus ltaliam. Cf. ii.
17. 1, though there the verb is
disserent.

Cn. ΙΙΙ. 1 se . . . consilio mis-
cuerant] The council must there·
sore apparently have been held out
os (loors. Consilium is osten used
in the concrete sense, though never
without relation to the common one3
itis a council of counsellors. Con-
cilium, on the other hand, is osten
an assembly‚ not necessarily select—
though more official than contio.

2 erusteus] Cf. ii. 82. 5.

mterpretauone] A correction sor
-nem, in which Ernesti has been
followed by other editors, saying,
‘dicta lzuc illuc trahuntur, non in-
terpretata! One would translate
the reading os the text-‘made a
speech, not, like most men, ambigu-
ous, with the intent to soree it to
either side by the construction he
gave it ;' but it may be doubted is
that os the MS. may not fairly mean
‘with the intent to force the con-
struction he gave it to either side!

descendisse tn] Used of entering

on any competition (Livy xxxvi. 7 ;
Hor. Od. iii. 1. 7, etc. ), though
commonly the accus. is os the con·
test entered on, not the side chosen.
This is in fact a pregnant construc-
tion, ‘committed himself to the
conflict, by committing himself on
the cause.'

gratior] A correction for gravior,
which would be harsh in construc-
tion with the dat., and, is admissible,
would be as likely to mean ‘the more
ofsensive,' as ‘ os the more weight.'

CH. IV. 1 solitus] Even before
the revolt?

2 ¹1·.Amp1us] The second name
never occurs without the first ; some
read Tampius.

cunctatior] This form is ques-
tioned by Drttger, who would read
cunctantior in all the passages (all in
silver-age writers) where it occurs;
but in Plin. Ep. ii. 16. 4it is coupled
with cautior, as though he considered
the form a regular one from the past
partic. used adjectivally, else we
might think it was virtually a com-
parative of cunctator, which we had
used similarly in ii. 25. 2 as a term
os mild censure.

amttam] Not traceable.
