legiones sequerentur 3 ejusdem proditione caeSOS‚ nullis super-

venientibus auxiliis.

Ignota haec ceteris exercitibus, neque

imperatori suo nuntiari, cum adcursu tot provinciarum exstingui

repens perfidia potuerit?

Hordeonius exemplares omnium 2

litterarum, quibus per Gallias Britanniamque et Hispanias
auxilia orabat, exercitui recitavit, instituitque pessimum facinus,
ut epistolae aquiliferis legionum traderentur; a quis ante

militi quam ducibus legebantur.

Tum e seditiosis unum 3

vinciri jubet, magis usurpandi juris quam quia unius culpa
foret. Motusque Bonna exercitus in coloniam Agrippinensem,
adfluentibus auxiliis Gallorum, qui primo rem Romanam
enixe juvabant: mox, valescentibus Gemianis, pleraeque civi-
tates adversum nos armatae spe libertatis et, si exuissent
servitium, cupidine imperitandi. Gliscebat iracundia legionum, 4

nec terrorem unius militis vincula indiderant.

Quin idem ille

arguebat ultro conscientiam ducis, tamquam nuntius inter

19. 33 apparently his subsequent
orders, ne terreret abemztcs, had not
ari‘ived in time.

imperatori suo] Their own nom-
inee, the object of their passionate
devotion. It appears that they make
the unreasonable complaint that
Vitellius is not told that there is
treachery on the Rhine, so that he
may support his faithful troops there
with the forces of Gaul and Spain—
not the better founded one, that his
faithful troops on the Rhine were
neutralised by treachery, to distract
any forces that might have been
summoned to support him on the Po.

2 exemplares] Sc. libros. The
only other place where the masc.
form occurs is in Fronto, Ep. ii. 5.

aquiliferis leg-tonum] Instead of
to Officers os his own staff3 his
motive was that these would not be
trusted by his own soldiers to de-
liver the despatcheS. Tac. calls it
pessimum fau-inus, because he rightly
holds Flaccus responsible sor the
rnen carrying their distrust of the

generalswiththem. Lipsius’sugges-
tion that despatches made public
were read ad szgrna hardly accounts
for their being delivered to the
standard-hearers os other legions
than those receiving them.

3 unum] Cf. i. 84. 2.

usurpandi juris] This use of the
gerundive genitive in a final sense,
though not unknown in earlier Latin
(ag. Liv. xxvii. 9, ea prodendi im-
perii Romani, trath’ndae Hannibali
victoriae) is especially common in
Tac.‚ ag. Ann. ii. 59. 1, cogno-
scendae antiquitatzk. It is probably
not an ellipsis of causa, but the
sense (which is quite as much ‘by
way of’ as ‘for the purpose os')
lies in the case itself; perhaps
there is a conscious imitation of the
equivalent constr. in Greek.

mox] See 54 sqq„ especially 55.
1, and, for the mutual jealousies of
the Gaulish states, 59. 2.

armatae] M. has arma: perhaps
arma sumpsere is better, as the latter
word might be omitted before spe.
