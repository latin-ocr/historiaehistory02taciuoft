points to a slight distinction between
the words. These two were the
only persons that heard, not only
the words, but even the tone and
substance of the conversation. For
Cluvius Rufus see i. 8. 2, 76. 2,
ii. 65. 1, 4. Silius Italicus, the

specimen partium] From his
character in i. 10 we are hardly
