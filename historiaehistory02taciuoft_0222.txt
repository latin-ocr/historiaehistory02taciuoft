CORNELII TACITI

Electa nox atra nubibus 3 et prono amne rapti, 2

Prima caedes astu adjuta:

incisis tabernaculorum funibus, suismet tentoriis coopertos

trucidabant.
trahere puppis.

Aliud agmen turbare classem, inicere vincla,
thue ad fallendum silentio, ita coeptas

caede, quo plus terroris adderent, cuncta clamoribus misce-

bant.

Romani volneribus exciti quaerunt arma, ruunt per

vias, pauci ornatu militari, plerique circum brachia torta veste

et strictis mucronibus.
errore hostium servatur.

insignem, illic ducem rati, abripiunt.
egerat, ut plerique credidere, ob stuprum Claudiae Sacratae-
Vigiles flagitium suurn ducis dedecore5

mulieris Ubiae.

Dux semisomnus ac prope intectus 4
Namque praetoriam navem vexillo

Cerialis alibi noctem

excusabant, tamquam jussi silere, ne quietem ejus turbarent3

ita, intermisso signo et vocibus, se quoque in somnum lapsos.

Multa luce revecti hostes, captivis navibus, praetoriam trire-

mem flumine Luppia donum Veledae traxere.

2 Electa .
Germ. 43. 6.

vallum] The camp where the
soldiers lodged and the vessels
drew up for the night.

tentoriis] M. has loriis, whence
the MS. copies and some edd.
stupidly make coriis. No doubt
the teuts were of leather; but a
serious English historian would
scarcely, in a parallel case, say,
‘in their own canvas‚’ though
‘canvas' has a quasi-proverbial
usage in this sense, which coria has
not. In Ann. iv. 72. 2, however,
coria, as well as terga, is used of
the raw material.

puppis] Were the ships drawn
up with the bow to the shore in
river navigation‚ there being neither
room nor the same need obvertere
pelago proras as at sea?

3 silentio depends on a verb
of neutral meaning (peregerant, or
the like), or even of opposite mean-

. nubibus] Cf.

Civilem

ing (ag. condiderant), to be sup· “

plied srom miscebant.

4 servatur] From capture, 21.
5. He was cut off, and might
have been captured, but that they
thought they had got him already.

ut plerique credidere] The fact
(cs. iv. 77. 1) of his unmilitary
absence from the camp was cer-
tain ; the scandalous motive alleged
for it was only probable.

5 signo et vocibus] The trumpet
that passed round (like the bell in
Greece‚ Thuc. iv. 135) at each
watch of the night, and challenges
or signals, like the modern ‘All 's
well,’ of the sentinels themselves.

se quoque] Their misconduct
was undoubted; they could only
say that is they were asleep at
their posts, the general was asleep

off his. Tacitus seems to suggest s
as possible that they invented the Ἰ

story against him to excuse them-
se ves.
