questioned, but is generally ad-
mitted) in accordance with this
decree os the Senate, provides that
X'espasian should have the same
rights and privileges as Augustus,
Tiberius, and Claudius. Gaius and
Nero had claimed powers and titles
which could not be allowed as pre-
cedents ε Galba, Otho, and Vitellius
had had too short reigns to put
their powers in ure, and perhaps
were considered to have disputable
right to such powers as they had
exercised.

per Gallias fflspamasque] By
Vindex and Gall›a; the Germans
were called out by Vitellius (and
perhaps Verginius), Illyricum by
the Othonians, and again by An-

doubt, on hearing os the victory
at Cremona.) Then, though he
dated his reign from his proclama-
tion by the troops (ii. 79. 2), not
from the Senate’s indorsement, his
tone towards them was what that
of an emperor, when once made,
ought to be; while as he did not
write like a man waiting on fortune,
they hoped that his constitutional
temper was likely to be permanent.

torship, says Suetonius: but he left
the judicial functions to the second
Praetor on the list. Can this be
reconciled with Tacitus' statement
