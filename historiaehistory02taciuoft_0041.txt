Ceteri, trepidis jam Vitellianis, seque e vallo praecipitantibus,

perrupere.

Completur caede quantum inter castra murosque
Ac rursus nova laborum facies, ardua urbis

moenia, saxeae turres, ferrati portarum obices, vibrans tela

miles, frequens obstrictusque Vitellianis partibus Cremonensis

populus, magna pars Italiae stato in eosdem dies mercatu

congregata3 quod defensoribus auxilium ob multitudinem,

obpugnantibus incitamentum ob praedam erat.

Rapi ignes 2

Antonius inferrique amoenissimis extra urbem aedificiis jubet,

si damno rerum suarum Cremonenses ad mutandam fidem

traherentur.

Propinqua muris tecta, et altitudinem moenium

egressa, fortissimo quoque militurn complet, illi trabibus

tegulisque et facibus propugnatores deturbant.

Jam legiones

in testudinem glomerabantur, et alii tela saxaque incutiebant,

cum languescere paulatim Vitellianorum animi.

Ut quis 2

ordine anteibat, cedere fortunae, ne, Cremona quoque excisa,
nulla ultra venia, omnisque ira victoris non in volgus inops

poetical —not that Tac. would have
avoided it if it were. See Plaut.
Mil. G. 2. 2. 23, Chi abit, conclamo
‘Heus,’ etc.; Caes. B. G. i. 47
fin. (Ariovistus) conclamavit, ‘ Quid
ad se venirent?’ There is therefore
no need to refer to the use of the
word at funerals, as though Tac.
meant, ⁴ His shout showed that all
was over.'

vacui] Any tents or huts that
the soldiers set up would be close
to their lines and would not need
to be deep, as the circuit must have
beenimmense. Besides, the majority
of the Vitellians had only just come
up, and had not had time to encamp
at all.

CH. XXX. 1 nova laborum
facies] Virg. Aen. vi. 103.

2 egressa] Common though only
post-Augustam, in the sense of
(figuratively) ‘outstepping‚ going
beyond the limits of’ (eng. Anu.

iii. 30. 2, familia . . . praeturam
qgm¹essa; xvi. 10. 5, sexum egressa).
But this is the only instance quoted
where, having got a figurative sense
from a physical one, the word is
turned back into another physical
sense.

CH. XXXI. 1 tela saxaque]
From engines, as well as the extern-
porised missiles described just before.

2 Ut quis] So M.: ut quisque
would be more natural Latin, but
this is Tacitean, Ann. ii. 24. 6, 73.
6, 83. 2, iv. 23. 2, 36. 5. In all
but the first of these passageS, the
word is used with an adj. as predi-
cate—the positive and comparative
being about equally frequent, here
it might be said that there is a com-
parative sense. The indefinite pro-
noun quis is most frequently used
with relative adverbs‚ and there is
no reason why it should not be with
ut, the most general of them.
