any terms consistent with the funda-
mentals of their religion, has marked
them before and since. In this
sentence Tacitus probably hardly
means to say, that they considered
martyrs and soldiers slain in a holy
war to be the only persons immortal;
if he does, it is no doubt an ex-
aggeration osa well-founded feeling,
that ‘ les juifs n'ont e'te amene's au
dogme de‘ l'immortalite que par la
necessite' d'un tel dogme pour don-
ner un sens au martyre ' (Renan,
l'Anteclzrist, c. xvii. p. 467).

corpora condere quam cremare]
We never in the Old Testament hear
of burning the dead otherwise thanas
adisgrace (Jos. vii. 25, etc.)‚ except
in the hasty funeral of Saul and his
sons (1 Sam. xxxi. 11), and the
many hasty funerals of a pestilence
(Amos vi. 10). It does not seem
to have been thought of in the last
siege, when the dead were from
their numbers left unburied.

eademque cura] Embalmment;
the Jewish, however, was far less
elaborate. The Egyptians stuffed
the body with spices, the Jews
wrapped it up tightly with spices
over 1t.

de infernis persuasio] Probably
he means only the belief in a judg-
ment after death. The state of the
dead is never, in Graeco-Latin
mythology, determined on purely

judicia] principles, hence two re-
ligions in which it was, appeared
substantially identical.

6 mente sola] Cf. Germ. 9. 3,
secretum illud quod sola reverentia
vident. Diodorus and Juvenal re-
gard the non-anthropomorphic wor-
ship as dement-worship, Strabo as
rising from this to pantheism.

tempus] Possibly he remembers
that there was one at Heliopolis,
and one at Gerizim, as well as at
Jerusalem; possibly he includes the
synagogues under the name. More
probably he uses the plural vaguely:
most people have statues in their

temples, but the Jews will have
none in theirs.

7 non caesaribus] 9. 8.

tibia tympanisque] Familiar from
Ps. el. Of the use of ivy we have
no other evidence, but the theory
that they worshipped Dionysus, so
far as they could be said to worship
any real god, seems to have been
as old at least as the Antiochian
persecution ; see 2 Maec. xiv. 33,
3 Maec. ii. 29. It is found also
in Plutarch, Quaest. Conv. iv. 6.
He remarks, rightly enough, on the
feast of Tabernacles being a vintage
festival, Deut. xvi. 13, but adds
that they kept after it a feast bearing
the name of Bacchus, which must
be a blunder. The next consider-
able feast, that of the Dedication,
