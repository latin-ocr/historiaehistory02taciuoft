privatis utriusque rebus auctoritate pecuniaque Vespasianum

- tremo in aede Apollinis, ut fama fuit, pepigere.

3 Id sabino . . . id vespasiano]
It was not a legitimate object of
ambition for Sabinus to displace his
brother, but it was to secure the
next place to him—a place sure to
be secured by whoever brought
over the city to him.

CH. LXV. 1 senecta] He was
older than Vespasian, who was sixty,
11. 74. 4.

2 privans utriusque rebus . . .
V. anteibat] 75. 2: contrast how-
ever i. 46. 2.

adfectam ejus fidem] According
to Suetonius, this was just aster his
government of Africa, and he sees
a proof of his integrity in office, in
his having made no money by it:
contrast sup. ii. 97. 4.

praejuvisse] ἅπαξ λεγόμενον :
usually explained, ‘to have helped
in time.’ Or. supposes it to be
formed on the analogy of προβοηθεΐν.
It seems almost to suit the context
better, to give the prep. the sense
it bears in praegrava and praeclud0‚
of ‘ getting in the way,’ so that the
meaning would be ‘to have given
embarrassing help '—- combining the
meanings of <fficium and qfficere.

domo agrisque pignori acceptis]
Which struck most people as sharp
practice with a brother, and they
expected him to resent it. Or.
truly says, that it might proceed
only from the timid and suspicions
temper ascribed to him here and in
ii. 63. 5.

3 Melior] More charitable‚ and
perhaps more probable. The judg-
ment spoken of is a contemporary
one (like erant qui . . . incesserent),
as appears from the presents abhor-
rere and agitare.

Apollinis] Palatini, Or.

ut fama. ruit] Tac. does not doubt
that Vitellius resolved to resign‚ nor
perhaps that the terms were agreed
on with Sabinus3 but while it was
reported that the ternis were agreed
on at this particular interview, he
points out that only two eminent
men knew what had really passed
then. He accordingly omits the
specific statement of Suetonius, that
Sabinus promised salutem et milies
sertertium.
