campaigns. Compare Jos. B. J
v. 1. 6.

6) after the campaign against
Vitellius. From Josephus (B. J.
iv. 11. 5, v. 1. 6) it appears that
Titus did not bring the two whole
legions with him, but a picked
force of 2000 men from thern.

4 Sohaemus] Josephus always
spells him Σόεμος. He was king of
Emesa, brother and successor to
Aziz, the first husband of Drusilla,
the sister of Agrippa. See Jos.
Ant. xx. 7. 1, 8. 4 init.

Antiochi] See on ii. 25. 3, 81. 1.
Epiphanes joined the army later,
with a further soree, disciplined in
the Macedonian manner: he and
they seem to have displayed a good
deal of useless gallantry‚ Jos. Β.

estimates the royal contingents at
nearly 14, 000 men V espasian had
begun the war with 60, 000 in all

(Β. J. iii. 4. 2); Titus' reinforce-
ments must have more than made
up for the numbers lost in the
campaign 01· drawn off for the civil
war. Dr. Merivale's estimate of
80, 000 for the u hole besieging army
is perhaps not too much.

occupandi.. . vacuum] ‘Of
being the χῖ] st to secure an emperor
not yet pre-engaged.' Titus was
not strictly speaking princeps, but
it seemed more profitable to court a
future emperor who had not chosen
his favourites, than even an actual
one who presumably had. For the
sense of vacuus, compare the legal
application to ownerless property,
e g. Hor. Sat. ii. 5. 50, in zacuum
venias, or still more that of multer
vacua, Ann. xiii. 44. 2.

5 composito agmine] The order
of march is minutely described by
Josephus, v. 2. 1.

haud procu] 11] At Gibeah of
Saul, thirty stadia from Jerusalem,
JOS. l. c. Compare Is. x. 29, for the
natural line of march upon the
town.
