accuracy, os the latter document),
but owed much more to the loyal
as well as judicious diplomacy of
Simon and Jouathan.

3 reges inposuere] Their inde-
pendence was recognised by Deme·
trius in stc, 143, 1 Mace. xiii. 4¹ :
it was infringed ten years later, after
the death os Simon, by Antiochus
Vin, Sidetes, jos. Ant. xii. 8. 2 sqq„
B. J. i. 2. 5, but without permanent
effect. Simon and his son John
Hyrcanus, however, took no title
but those of ἀρχιερεὺς μέγας καὶ
στρατηγὸς καὶ ἡγούμενος-Νι Maec.
xiii. 42: the Hebrew titles repre-
sented by the two last words are
uncertain, as they seem not to be
found on coins). The first titular
‘king' os the IIashmonean dynasty
was Aristobulus, the son and suc-
cessor of Hyrcanus, Jos. Ant. xiii.
11, r, B. J. i. 3. 1.

mobilitate . . . dominatione]
The people revolted from Alex-
ander Janneas, the brother and
successor of Aristobulus‚ Jos. Ant.
xiii. 13. 5 sqq„ B. J. i. 4. 4sqq.,
and were only put down after a
bloody civil war, in which Alex-
ander employed foreign mercenaries,
but the rebels invoked the aid of
Demetrius of Syria, which seems to
have brought the national feeling
over to his side.

rugas civium] 8000 are said to
have fied from horror at the cruelties
of Alexander after the insurrection
was suppressed, Jos. B. J. i. 4.

⁶ fratrum . . . neces] Aristobulus
was said to have starved his mother

to death, and was certainly entrap-
ped into ordering the assassination
os his savourite brother Antigonus :
Alexander put to death another
brother, apparently less unjustly3
and there was a civil war, though
without actual fratricide‚ between
Hyrcanus 11. and Aristobulus 11.
The murder of a wife does not
occur in the Hashmonean dynasty
until the last member of it, Mari·
anme, was slain by Herod.

solita. regibus] ·1t is not unlikely
that the assumption of the roy al
title really produced a demoralisiyng
effect. Aristobulus on his accession
imprisoned his three younger bro-
thers, almost as a matter of course,
and. as already mentioned, put his
andhis father' s savourite, Antigonus,
to death. His grandfather Simon,
and John the eldest of the five sons
of Mattathias, had served cheer-
sully and faithfully in subordinate
commands under their younger bro·
thers Judas and Jonathan.

adsumebatur] Tacitus sunda-
mentally misconceives the history,
thinking they were kings first and
priests afterwards.
