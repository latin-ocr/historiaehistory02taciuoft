terracing of hillsides so as to make
the most of the scanty soil, to which
the ancient fertility was due. It
should be remembered that, to say
nothing of the extortion of govern-
ment or insecurity of property, the
Moslem occupation has discouraged

, the culture of the vine, for which

the country is specially adapted.
Vine-growing land down to the
Captivity waS, ifneglected, fertile in
weeds, and comland became pasture
(Is. vii. 23 sqq.); seventy years'
neglect did the soil more good than
harm, but with twelve hundred
years’ neglect the soil has washed
away altogether. There was always
more or less of a contrast between
the character of the districts known
to us as Galilee (see Polyb. v. 70.
3), Samaria, and Judaea (not to

marked than now, see Jos. B. J.
iii. 3, also Hecataeus ap. euml. c. Ap.
i. 29. It is curious, however, that
the recent explorers fail to find any
traces of the forests so often men-
tioned in the books of Samuel,
though round Jerusalem the roots
of extirpated trees are still found in
sufficient plenty to supply the city
with fire-wood.

balsamum et palmae] Both ap-
parently were mostly confined to
the quasi-tropical climate of the
Jordan valley3 see Jos. Ant. xiv.
4. 1 init„ xv. 4. 2, Strabo xvi. p.
763, sor their growth at Jericho.
The balm, as is well known, is first
heard of across the Jordan; it is now
chiefly grown near Tiberias. The

palm is quite recently extinct.

3 pavent venae] So Plin. H.
N. xii. 25. 54, ferro laedi vitalia
odit; cf. Jos. Ant. xiv. l.c. We
should naturally understand Tacitus'
language, ‘the veins shrink‚' z'.e.
contract instead of opening to let
the gum flow : but the parallel pas-
sage in Pliny seems to show that
the meaning is rather ‘arbusculae

parles intimae ac vitales laeduntur’

(Or.) Perhaps the sear of steel
cutting too deep was rather an after—
thought than the real reason for the
custom : gathering the balsam was
a mystical and quasi-religious act,
and so was performed, just as cir-
cumcision was, with a primitive
stone knife. It seems unnecessary,
as it is certainly post-Tacitean, to
think it natural to mark szv . . . venae
as a parenthesis.

4 Libanum] Including the eastern
as well as the western range. Her-
mon is the only snowy summit that
can be considered to be included in
the Jewish country : it is moreover
the source of the Jordan.

erigit] It would have been natural
Latin to say mons Libanus mgimr:
it is Tacitean Latin to say (terra)
Libanum erigit. Perhaps the nearest
similar caseis Cic. de Leg. i. 9. 26,
(natura) solum hominem erexit, ‘ has
made him erect.’

opacum] With forests: Tacitus'
notion of a hot country was a
desert.

fidumque mvibus] The snow is
said to cover the highest peaks of
both Libanus and Antilibanus sor
the greater part of the year, and,
