the missortunes began then, which
now were discovered, and might be
cured.

CH. XXVI. inclinatio] Change.
especially weakening, of purpose.
So Amr. i. 28. 4, os the terror
inspired in a mutinous army by an
eclipse.

spe vitae] His countrymen were
talking about capitis poena, so that
he had not the hope os living on in
the honourable character of an
exiled patriot.

2 Nabanae] Presumably the
Yssel, though some suggest the
Vecht. On the former there ap·
pears to have been a town or station
called Navalia, and though this
seems prima facie a Latin name, it
may have been founded on a
native one os the river ; cs. Amisia
(Ann. ii. 8. 2) at the mouth os the
Ems, a place perhaps surviving
as Ernden. Nicolas Colinus, the
author of a Low-Dutch metrical
chronicle of the twelsth century,
calls the river Nau lVale, ‘New
NVaal ; ' now, as Civilis had entirely
evacuated the island aster the naval
skirmish, we cannot think of the
Lek or any canal leading out of
the Waal. But if the Yssel had no
communication with the Rhine
before the canal cut by Drusus,

Cuncta inter nos inimica, hostilia, ab illo coepta, a
Erga Vespasianum vetus mihi observantia;

Hoc Primo Antonio 4

that canal and the river it led to
might conceivably be called a
new Waal, as being a new
divergent branch os the Rhine, and
so co-ordinate with the old Waal.

pons] We may remember the
conversation of Arminius and his
brother across the Weser, Ann. ii.
9. If that scene be historical,
there must have been bridge-ends
on either side to bring them within
arrow-shot or ear-shot os each
other. Compare also Titus' pass?
with the Jews, in Jos. B. J. vi. .
2, across the broken bridge from
the Temple to the Upper City;
and Or. quotes later instances of
treaties being negotiated under
similar conditions.

3 vtteun] Al. leg. Vitalianum ;
M. has Vitellium. The termina·
tion may as conceivably be an anti-
cipation of that of legatum as of
that os the word itsels.

observantia] The sentence is
quoted by Sidonius Apollinaris,
Ep. iv. 14 init. (to Polemius, a
descendant os Tacitus’ own); in
place of this word he has amicitia,
no doubt by a slip.

et eum . . . vocabamur] The
regretsul cynicism is doubtless due
to Tacitus, not to Civilis. But we
are probably to understand as a
