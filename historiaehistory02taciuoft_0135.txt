pro modestia accipiebatur. Referente Caesare de restituendis 2
Galbae honoribus, censuit Curtius Montanus ut Pisonis quo-
que memoria celebraretur. Patres utrumque jussere: de
Pisone irritum fuit. Tum sorte ducti per quos redderentur 3
bello rapta, quique aera legum vetustate delapsa noscerent
figerentque‚ et fastos, adulatione temporum foedatos, exonera-

Juliano praetura, postquam cognitus est ad Vespasianum con—

rent, modumque publicis inpensis facerent.
fugisse: Gripho honor mansit. Repeti inde cognitionem
inter Musonium Rufum et Publium Celerem placuit, damna-
tusque Publius et Sorani manibus satisfactum. Insignis 5
publica severitate dies ne privatim quidem laude caruit.
Justum indicium explesse Musonius videbatur: diversa fama
Demetrio Cynicam sectam professo, quod manifestum reum
ambitiosius quarn honestius defendisset. Ipsi Publio neque
animus in periculis neque oratio subpeditavit. Signo ultionis 6

2 caesare] See on i. 29. 3.

de Pisone irritum fuit] It served
however to license his brother keep-
ing his imago, 39. 4.

3 aera legum, etc.] This may or

see eng. Anu. xv. 23. 3, 4.

modum publicis inpensis] Pro-
bably correlative to the last clause t
the lestivals were to be celebrated
at public eost.

4 Gripho honor mansit] As there
were sixteen praetors it wasascarcely
noticeable anomaly for an extra-
ordinary one to hold office sor a

practically convenient, when Domi-
tian⁷s tenure of the first place on
the list was little more than nomhral,
to have some one willing and com-

business of the office. Domitian
had perhaps held a similar super-
numerary praetorship before Fron-
tinus⁷ resignation, see 3. 5.

Repeti . . . cognitionem] See
10. 3.
5 indicium] M. has judicium ; of

be confused, and the sense seems
to require the correction 3 judicium
could not be constructed with ex-

Demetrio] He was a friend of
Thrasea's, Ann. xvi. 34. 1.

ambitiosius] Trying to gain a
political reputation and (still more)
a political following. Under the
Republic this was the avowed
motive. or at least the expected re-
