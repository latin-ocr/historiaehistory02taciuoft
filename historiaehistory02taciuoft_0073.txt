HISTORIARUM III. 67. 61

Mucianus ullam in Vitellium nisi occidendi licentiam habeant.
Non a Caesare Pompeium, non ab Augusto AntoniumS
incolumes relictos, nisi forte Vespasianus altiores spiritus
gerat, Vitellii cliens, cum Vitellius collega Claudio foret.

Perstare militem, superesse studia populi.

the best known, rather than the
worst, of the leaders on that side.

licentiam] Rather from the
soldiers than from Vespasian, per-
haps rather from circumstances
than either.

5 Non . . . relictos] A bad argu·
ment (of course not of Tacitus' own) ;
neither had ordered his opponent’s
death, and Caesar at least was be-
lieved to have sincerely regretted it.

altiores spiritus] Generally in
a bad sense, and even here equi-
valent to the superbia of ξ 2.

vitemi cliens] When Vitellius
was consul, Vespasian, like other
men with a career before them,
might pay him visits of courtesy
that could be thus described.

couega Claudio] He was consul
in the year when Claudius and his

not many earlier than those enumer-

has neglzgeret, which some may think
more Tacitean‚ ut being then con·

to account for her not being among
the objects of his solicitude. Sue-
tonius tells a rather incredible story
that her son had her starved in
obedience to a German prophetess.
