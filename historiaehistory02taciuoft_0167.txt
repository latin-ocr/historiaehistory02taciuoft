Treverorum legatio

illic opperiebatur, acerrimo instinctore belli Tullio Valentino.

Is meditata oratione cuncta, magnis imperiis objectari solita, 7

contumeliasque et invidiam in Populum Romanum effudit:

turbidus miscendis seditionibus, et plerisque gratus vecordi

facundia.

At Julius Auspex, e primoribus Remorum, vim

Romanam pacisque bona dissertans, et ‘sumi bellum etiam

ab ignavis, strenuissimi cujusque periculo geri, jamque super

caput legiones,' sapientissimum quemque reverentia fideque,

juniores periculo ac metu, continuit.

Et Valentini animum

suleret] 1f he seized the practical
direction os the army, he might take
measures unsavourable either to im-
mediate victory or to subsequent
pacification. Domitian was sus-
pected (86. 1) of having attempted a
treasonable intrigue with the army
a little later: but Mucianus does
not yet suspect him of anything
worse than indiscreet vanity.

5 XI et vm] M. has the num-
bers os several of these legions
written (contrary to the usual prac-
tice) in figures, and some of them
cormpt. While correcting the
errors (which can be done with
tolerable certainty, from the earlier
and later notices of the various
legions), it is as well to leave the
indication of their source.

ereeens coneriptis] Apparently
the e classicis legio of iii. 55. 1,
which must be different froin the

monte Graio] In ii. 66. 5 we
have the commoner form Alpibus
Graiis.

6 Tullio] Had an ancestor of
his become a client of Q. Cicero?

CH. LXIX. super caput] We
can easily say in English ‘were
hanging over their heads: ² in Latin
the image is naturally expressed by
the verb imminere. It would per-
haps be fancisul to suppose that, in
so short a speech, and that report-
ed in oratio obliqua, we have an
attempt at a dramatic picture of
Celtic eloquence, as in c. 64 we
have of Germanic.

provinciarum aemulatio seems
almost to mean what we should
call ‘provincial jealousy2’ for it
