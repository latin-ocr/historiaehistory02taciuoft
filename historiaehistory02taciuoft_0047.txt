HISTORIARUM 111. 37. 35

pietatem militum laudibus cumulat. Publium Sabinum, prae-
torii praefectum, ob amicitiam Caecinae vinciri jubet, substi-
37 tuto in locum ejus Alfenio Varo. Mox senatum composita
in magnificentiam oratione adlocutus, exquisitis patrum adula—
tionibus attollitur. Initium atrocis in Caecinam sententiae
a L. Vitellio factum 3 dein ceteri, composita indignatione,
quod consul rempublicam, dux imperatorem, tantis opibus,
tot honoribus cumulatus amicum prodidisset, velut pro Vitellio
conquerentes, suum dolorem proferebant. Nulla in oratione 2
cujusquam erga Flavianos duces obtrectatio: errorem inpru-
dentiamque exercituum culpantes, Vespasiani nomen suspensi
et vitabundi circumibant. Nec defuit qui unum consulatus
diem (is enim in locum Caecinae supererat‚) magno cum
. inrisu tribuentis accipientisque eblandiretur. Pridie Kalendas 3
Novembres Rosius Regulus iniit ejuravitque. Adnotabant
periti, nunquam antea, non abrogato magistratu, neque lege
lata, alium subfectum. Nam consul uno die et ante fuerat
Caninius Rebilus, G. Caesare dictatore, cum belli civilis

praemia festinarentur.

dignatione] Note that Tac. has no
prejudice against the repetition of a
word that has already appeared in
‘the sentence, even when, as here,
it is not used in quite the same
sense. The second composita means,
like the usage noted at i. 71. 1, not
that their indignation was insincere
(for Caecina was really unpopular),
but that its form of expression was
studied, and even affected. The
first composita may be compared
with ii. 9. 2.

mander-in-chief3' the same anti·

suppose therefore that one or other
of these formalities‚ probably the
first, was observed in the substitu-

that case was parallel to this,-a
