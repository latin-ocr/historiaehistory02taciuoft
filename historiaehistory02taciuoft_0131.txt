HISTORIARUM IV. 36. 117

Cohortes Geldubam perrexere, manentibus, ut fuerant, castris,
quae relictorum illic militum praesidio tenebantur. Non erat
dubium quantumin regressu discriminis adeundum foret fru-
mentatoribus onustis perculsisque. Addit exercitui suo Vocula 4
mille delectos e quinta et quinta decima legionibus apud
Vetera obsessis, indomitum militem et ducibus infensum.
Plures quam jussum erat profecti palam in agmine fremebant
At qui 5
remanserant, desertos se abducta parte legionum querebantur.
Duplex hinc seditio, aliis revocantibus Voculam, aliis redire

two places. But as they probably
would keep at some distance from
that river, they may have had, twice
or ostener, to cross branches of the
N iess.

3 Geldubam] More than two-
thirds of the way to N ovesium, so
that perhaps they were there secure
of their communications with it:
the only difficulty was, how to get
back to Vetera.

4 indomitum] ‘High-spirited:'
per se it would bear a good sense,
and here has rather a neutral than
a bad. Vocula's strategy was pro-
bably sound, if the conditions of
regular war had been realised. His
object was to concentrate the Ro-
man army at Novesium, only dis-
tracting the enemy by leaving a
garrison in Vetera—a small one, as
provisions were scarce. With well-
affected troops on his own side, he

might have driven the enemy from
both Vetera and Mogontiaeum ; or
if not, with an enemy that could be
trusted to obser-ve the laws of war,
it would have been no intolerable
evil if 4000 men were forced to
capitulate at the former place, after
having neutralised a larger number
for some weeks. As it was, the
main army was no sooner assembled
than it quarrelled : and the garrison
was, as it expected, abandoned to
famine and massacre.

famem, insidias] Perhaps rather
an apposition than an asyndeton.

CH. XXXVI. capit] ‘Occupies‚’
evidently unopposed.

2 secundis adversisque] The
temporary relies of Vetera and
establishment of communications
with Nomsium, and the defeat in
the cavalry action.
