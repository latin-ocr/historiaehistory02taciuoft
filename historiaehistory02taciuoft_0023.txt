HISTORIARUM III. 14. 15

sine volnere, vinctas manus et capta traderent arma? quas
enirn ex diverso legiones? nempe victas. Et abesse unicum
Othoniani exercitus robur, primanos quartadecimanosque 3
quos tamen isdem illis campis fuderint straverintque, ut arma-
torum millia, velut grex venalium, exsuli Antonio donum
darentur. Octo nimirum legiones unius classis accessionem 6
fore. Id Basso, id Caecinae visum: postquam domos, hortos,
opes principi abstulerint, etiam militibus principem auferre.
Integros incruentosque, Flavianis quoque partibus viles, quid
14 dicturos reposcentibus aut prospera aut adversait' Haec
singuli, haec universi, ut quemque dolor inpulerat, vocifer-
antes, initio a quinta legione orto, repositis Vitellii imaginibus

vincla Caecinae iniciunt, Fabium Fabullum, quintae legionis

simple verb should not be thus used,
though some of its compounds are
commonet in metaphorical senses.

vinctas . . . capta] Proleptic,
yet it would be more of a translation,
‘their hands as bound, their arms
as taken,' than ‘ their hands to bind,
their arms to capture.

abesse. . . quartadecimanosque]
The 1 st had been sent to Spain, the
14th to Britain, ii. 67. 2, 76. 2.

ut amatorum] Between these
words the inferior MSS. insert tol,
and to us, as well as to the scribes,
‘ thousands ' sounds bolder in Latin
than it does in English. The clause
ut . . . darentur depends on that
immediately preceding it 3 they had
gained the victory, only forthe troops
who gained it to be surrendered.

6 Octo . . . fore] ‘Thus, forsooth,
the adlzest'onof one sseet would be
worth eight legions,' C. and B.
Apparently every other commenta-
tor takes accessionem ‘ a makeweight,³
as in Liv. xlv. 39 Syphax is called
accessio belli Punici, his conquest
being a πάρεργον. And the order
of the words makes it practically
certain that octo legiones is the sub-
ject, not the predicate.

principi] M. has principer, but the

correction, though not necessary, is

justified becauseit improves the style.

militibus principem auferre has
perhaps some irony in it ; with any
Emperor less passive than Vitellius,
you would have said milites principi,
but, while they valued him, he had
never made thern feel that he either
valued them or held control of them.
There seem to be traces in M. of a
v. l. with militem ; it proves at least
that such was the natural expression,
even if we ought not to read some-
thing like N ipperdey's etiam mditem,
militibus principem auferre.

reposcentibus] A dat„ not agree-
ing with Flavianis partibus, but
:⁷on λόγον ἀπαιτοῦσιν, ‘to wlco-
ever asked them.’ Repesco is so
often used with rationem or some
such word, ‘to demand an account
of,' that here reposcere with an acc.
is used in the same sense as reposcere
rationem with a gen„ perhaps also
implying that no satisfactory answer
can be given ; cf. the use of requiro
almost = desidero.

aut. prospera aut adversa] What
use had been made of their victory,
or what defeat had caused their
surrender.

Cn. XIV. 1 quintae] Either he
