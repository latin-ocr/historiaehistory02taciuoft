5 repente fusis imbribus] So
that they were afraid to advance‚
even by the way that they had found
safe earlier in the day.

CH. XIX. Gallo Annio] iv. 68. 1.

decuma ex Η.] iv. 68. 5, 76. 2.
This was the Decuma Gemina, the
Decuma Fretensz's was in Judaea,

23 chaucorum auxilia] Cf. iv.
⁷ oppidum Batavorum] Not the
same as Batavodurum, which seems
to be fixed at the modern Wyk-by-
Duurstede, the point of divergence
of the Lek and Rhine, but some-
where on the Gaulish side of the
Waal, some suppose at Nymegen,
some (from the name) at Batenburg.

Romanum] A German army could
have swum.

3 molem, etc.] Drusus' object
was to secure for Gaul (including

the Batavian island) a good frontier
against Germany, by making the
&Vaal a manageable stream, and the
Rhine (with the Yssel joined to it

and rapid (Anu. ii. 6. 5) river.
Civilis' object was just the opposite,
to make the island a partos Ger-
many, with a good frontier towards
Gaul, by making the &Vaal the
larger river. Nature or history has
decided in Civilis' favour.

Druso Germanico] The title was
only voted to him on his death, and
borne by his sons.

4 continentium terrarum] To
be translated ‘ continuous land,⁷ but
Tacitus is aware that he is approxi-
mating to the technical geographical
ter-m ‘continent.’

use of the members of the council
of an independent city ; as coun-
