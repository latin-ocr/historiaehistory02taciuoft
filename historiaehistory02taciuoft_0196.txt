royal family. The last, recently
legalised at Rome, were there still
condemned by public opinion;
they are nowhere expressly for-
bidden in the law of Moses, though
it is doubtful if they were meant to
be tolerated by it (the relationship
of Othniel and Achsah, Jos. xv.
17, etc., is as ambiguous in
Hebrew as in English). But he is
more probably thinking of the
suspected incest of Agrippa and
Berenice, though the latter had a
history evacuating rather than
illustrating the contrast drawn by
Tacitus. She had insisted on the
circumcision of Polemo before she
would ma him, as her sister
Drusilla on that of Aziz ; but
neither scrupled to desert her pros-
elyte husband for the Gentiles Felix
and Titus.

the contrary, the custom seems to
have been general among the
nations influenced by Egyptian
civilisation, until it was discredited
by the higher civilisation os Greece
(lidi. ii. 36 sq., 104) : Joshua (v. 9)
felt that uncircumc'rsed people were
contemptible to the Egyptians. It
is disputed whether Jer. ix. 25, 6,
Ezek. xxxii. 19 sqq„ are meant to
group together circumcised but
heathen or ruined nations, to the
reproach of Israel or Egypt, or to
describe all the nations except Israel
as (at that period) uncircumcised.
The peculiarity of the Israelites was
the early age at which the eeremony
was performed ; in other Asiatic and
African races practising it, it is a
sort of sacrament os adolescence.

than the jews. It is true that
Jewish notions as to the duty os
marrying and leaving children
amounted to a superstition, but the

oldest Roman notions on the sub· .

ject were nearly the same. Agnati
has two semi-technical legal senses,
( 1 ) blood-relations traced exclusively
in male lines ; (2) as here, children
born after there are already enough
to keep up the family, or after a
will is made; see Cic. de Or. i. 57.
241, constat agnascendo rumpi testa-
mentum, ‘it is clear that a will is
set aside by a subsequent birth.'
ammos . . . putant] In spite of
the arguments of various theologians
since Warburton‚ it seems clear that
a shadowy life of the soul after death
was recognised by the primitive
Hebrews‚ as by almost all other
nafions, and further that the doctrine
of a Resurrection and final Judg-
ment appears in the Prophets some
time before the fall of the monarchy.
But the former doctrine (though
quite compatible on traditional
Christian principles with the other),
has of itself little moral efficacy;
the second was only forced into the
consciousness of the nation by the
persecution of Antiochus. The
moriendi contemptus was character·
istic of the nation from his age to
that of Hadrian, and reappeared in
the mediaeval persecutions3 but a
strong sense of the value of life, on
