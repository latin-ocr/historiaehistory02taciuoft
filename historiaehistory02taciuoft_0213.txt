Evenerant prodigia, quae neque hostiis neque votis

piare fas habet gens superstitioni obnoxia, religionibus adversa.
Visae per caelum concurrere acies, rutilantia arma, et subito

nubium igne conlucere templum. Exapertae repente delubri

fores, et audita major humana vox, excedere deos 3 simul

ingens motus excedentium. Quae pauci in metum trahebant:
pluribus persuasio inerat antiquis sacerdotum litteris contineri,

fin.‚ 2. 4 inim but if he had no
other authority, Tacitus' language
is inaccurate. The three factions
united sor the almost successful
assault on the Tenth Legion on
Olivet: but the surprise of the
Temple by John fell later. The
party warfare only ceased when the
siege was actually formed: and
even then the two parties were
hampered by mutual distrust.

CH. XIII. prodigia] Jos. B. J.
v1. 5. Ἴ.

quae . . . adversa] Le. the Jews
were more attached to their reli-
gious obseivauces than the Romans,
but the observances they were
most attached to were not of the
same order. It is scarcely relevant
to refer to the Mosaic prohibitions
of witchcraft and astrology: the
event of 2 Sam. xxiv. 16-18‚ which
apparently determined the Temple
site, is just what is meant by hostiis
atque votis piareprodzg‘ium.

visae . . . tempium] Nearly
all the prodigies described in Liv.
xxii. 1 as occurring at the beginning
of the second Punic VVar admit of
natural explanations: as to these,
it is worth remembering that the
aurora borealis of the summer of
1870 was seen as far south as
Palestine. We may also remem-
ber that more people noticed the
coincidence of that phenomenon with
the siege of Pan's, than would have
liked to own that they believed in
a connection.

2 Exapertae] So Or. for the

expertae of M.: Haase and Hahn
read et altatae, as the compound
form is not elsewhere found before
St. Augustine.

excedere deos] The pl. is not
used from carelessness: Jos. l. c.
gives the words heard (at the Feast
of Pentecost) as μεταβαίνωμεν
ἐντεῦθεν. Christian historialis are
generally disposed to accept the
story : but we should remember that
it is coupled, not only with the
‘prophecy' (which, whether really
supernatura] or not, was at least
aster Hebrew precedent) of Jesus
the son of Ananus, but with other
prodigies of a very childish and
rather heathenish character (ag.
βοῦς . . . ἔτεκεν ἄρνα ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ),
and that, though in itself not below
the religious dignity os the occasion,
it is capable of a pagan sense.
Excedere was almost a technical
word, correlative to evocare, to
describe the gods of a city about to
fall, leaving it to its fate, when
invited by pious or savoured besieg-
ers: see Virg. Aen. ii. 351, Plin.
N. H. xxviii. 2. 4.

in metum trahebant] So Ann.
i. 76. 6, varie trahebant, iii. 22. 6,
ad saevitiam trahebant, etc.

pluribus persuasio, etc„ refers
no doubt to the well-known ‘Pro-
phecy of the VVeeks’ in Dan. ix.
24 sqq„ coupled by Jews as by
Christians with the Messianic
empire, foretold ib. ii. 44, vii. 14.
Reading that passage straightfor-
wardly, it seems to fix the period
