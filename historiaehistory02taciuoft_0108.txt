CORNELII TACITI

jussu Vitellii Batavorum juventus ad delectum vocabatur,
quem, suapte natura gravem, onerabant ministri avaritia ac
luxu, senes aut invalidos conquirendo, quos pretio dimitterent.
Rursus inpubes sed forma conspicui (et est plerisque procera 2

pueritia,) ad stuprum trahebantur.

Hinc invidia ; et com-

positae seditionis auctores perpulere ut delectum abnuerent.
Civilis primores gentis et promptissimos volgi, specie epularum 3
sacrum in nemus vocatos, ubi nocte ac laetitia incaluisse videt,
a— laude gloriaque gentis orsus injurias et raptus et cetera

servitii mala enumerat.

CH. XIV. jussu vsteun] ii.
97. r.

gravem, onerabant] A transi-
tional use to that in ii. 52. 3, etc.‚
where onero has no more conscious
metaphor than the English ‘aggra-
vate.

2 et est . . . puel-ma] So that
they reached a presentable military
stature before the proper military
age. Also proceritas may be con-
sidered an element of forma, see
Germ. 20. 3.

compositae] M. has composui,
which may be right, as componere
seditionem commonly means not ‘to
get up an insurrection,’ but to put
it down. With either reading, the
word ,suggests a contrast between
the genuine popular discontent and
the artificial intrigue that took ad-
vantage of it.

3 specte epulam] A banquet
was the ordinary form os holding
a council, Germ. 22 . 3.

nocte ac laetitia] Not a mere

hendiadys, ⁸ nocte per laetitiam trans-
acta,¹ but ‘the late hour and the
free revel' (laetitia is ‘ jollity,’ a
euphemism sor something like
drunkenness) are conceived as eo-
ordinate causes of their excite-
ment.

4 Neque emm . . . haberi] Per-
haps ¹ it was no longer an alliance,
but they were treated‚' etc.‚ but it
seems better to give societatem a
concrete sense, ‘they were no
longer treated as an allied ccm-
munity, but . . .’

Quando legatum . .
‘How long would it be before
Flaccus came there' from the Up-
per Province? He would be bad
enough when he did come, but
meanwhile his subordinates were
intolerable ε they were only recalled
after unlimited plunder, and one or
two semi-judicial murders, and then
the successor was as bad.

sinus] Asii. 9²- 5, iii. 19. 3, etc. ;
‘ new receptacles sor stolen goods.’
