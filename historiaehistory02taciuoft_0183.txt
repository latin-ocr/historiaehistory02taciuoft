Simul visum eundem juvenem

Ptolemaeus, omine et mira· z

culo excitus, sacerdotibus Aegyptiorum, quibus mos talia

intellegere, nocturnos visus aperit.

Atque illis Ponti et

externorum parum gnaris, Timotheum Atheniensem e gente
Eumolpidarum, quem ut antistitem caerimoniarum Eleusine

exciverat, quaenam illa superstitio, quod numen, interrogat.
Timotheus, quaesitis qui in Pontum meassent, cognoscit3
urbem illic Sinopen, nec procul templum, vetere inter accolas
fama, Jovis Ditis: namque et muliebrem effigiem adsistere,

quam plerique Proserpinam vocent.

Sed Ptolemaeus, ut sunt 4

ingenia regum, pronus ad formidinem, ubi securitas rediit,
voluptatum quam religionum adpetens, neglegere paulatim,
aliasque ad curas animum vertere, donec eadem species terri-
bilior jam et instantior exitium ipsi regnoque denuntiaret, ni

jussa patrarentur.

from travellers where a god was
worshipped of form and attributes
such as he had seen. His account
does not differ very widely from
Tacitus'; Eustathius (a learned
bishop of the twelfth century, who
commented on ancient literature
from Homer downwards), dwells
more on the vagueness of the search,
and makes the Egyptians be guided
to Sinope by the Delphic oracle,
not by an Athenian at Alexandria.
He is however too late a writer for
discrepancies of details to be irn-
portant 3 it deserves more attention
that Clemens Alexandrinus ascribes
the mission to Sinope neither to
Soter nor Euergetes, but to Ptolemy
11.‚ Philadelphus. Neither Plutarch
nor St. Clement knows of the visit
to Delphi ; it is not likely that Eus-
tathius used Tacitus, but rather a
Greek account, closely resembling
his.

2 superstitio] Used also without
any bad sense in Sen. Ep. 95, vir-

Tum legatos et dona Scydrothemidi regiS

lutis quadam superstitione tenean-
tur. Possibly we ought to take
Cicero's word (de JV. D. ii. 28. 72)
sor the bad sense being the primi-
tive one, though his derivation is
absurd enough ; we then might ex-
plain it as meaning simply ‘excess‚’
making the root sto in the termina-
tion as nearly meaningless as pos-
sible. It seems however to suit
better with the usage of the word,
to suppose the primitive sense to
have been good, or at least neutral.
In Aen⁴ xii. 817, the play on the
words superstitio superis suggests
that, at least in Virgil's time, the
etymological meaning was a sense
of a power above one, but, as this
derivation accounts for the termina-
tion no better than the last, some
suggest that the first meaning is zzq.
ἐπιστήμη, and the history of the
word similar to that of ‘wizard.’
In old Latin the word is generally
applied to diviners and divination.
