Antonta] Distant a little to the
north of the Temple, opposite the
north—west angle.

(ΣΗ. XII. Templum . . . auos]
The platsorm now called ‘the Noble
Sanctuary' (Haram esh—Sheris) is
surrounded by walls now proved to
have been from 150 to 180 seet
high, being built out to east and
west of the narrow ridge of Mount
Moriah. The Temple stood in
some part of this area: opinions
differ whether in the centre or the
south-east or south-west angle. Of
the enormous substructions, part
almost certainly dates from Solo-
mon: and it is on the whole like-
liest, that the whole was included in
Herod‘s outer court—the south-east
corner, which is slighter work than
the rest, and supported on arches,
being perhaps added by him to the
older precinct. According to one
os the many theories advanced, the
Solomonic portion of this platsorm
was the Millo ( Lxx.'Axpa, Josephus’
name sor the Lower eity on and
around the Temple hill), on the
works of which Jeroboam was em-
ployed: we are on safer ground is
we compare 1 Kings xii. 4 with
Liv. i. 56. 1, 2. As the second
Temple of the Jews so nearly coin-
cided in its fall with that os the
Romans, so their first Temples
present a more than superficial
parallel in their origin and their in-
fluence on the national history.

por-meus] See Jos. Β. J. vi. 2.
9, 3. 1, etc., for the desperate con-
flict at these, decided at last by fire

rather than sword: and compare
above, iii. 71. 2. In time of
(comparative) peace, the colonnades
served an exactly opposite purpose ε
the gat-rison of Antonia, advanc-
ing along their rooss, could com-
mand the Temple courts without
profaning them by entering‚ on
occasions like that of Acts xxi. 31
sq.

Pons peremne aquae] Called
‘the Conduit' (Is. viii. 63 cf. St.
John ix. 7), which became practi-
cally the pr. n., Shiloah or Siloam.
Josephus describes it (v. 4 1) as
’γλυκεῖάν τε καὶ πολλὴν οὖσαν, but in
v. 9. 4 he says that it ran short
just before the siege. In St.
Jerome‘s time (Comm. in Jes. l.· c.)
it was intermittent, though still
abundant: it is now ordinarily
rather scanty, but sub'ject to such
sudden rises as he describes. The
modern city is pretty well supplied
with water, but it is thought that
the ancient sources are more abun-
dant. Hezekiah had, expressly in
view of a siege, led another water·
course to the same point os issue as
this (Is. xxii. 9. 11, 2 Kings xx.
20, 2 Chron. xxxii. 3o); an aque-
(luct, supposed to be h'is, has been
lately traced. From Ecclus. xlviii.
17 we perhaps should understand
that it remained in working order ,
as late as B.c. cir. 260, and isso, it
doubtless did down to the time we
are concerned with. Certainly τ
Hezekiah's object (2 Chron. xxxii.

4) of embarrassing the besiegers was ,-
attained. Dio lxvi. 4. 5, τὸ δέ δὴ ·
πλεῖστον ol Ῥωμαῖοι τῇ ἀνυδρίᾳ
ἐκακοπάθουν, καὶ φαῦλον καὶ πόρρωθεν
ὕδωρ ὑπαγόμενοι. i 4
