CORNELII TACITI

Marti, grates agimus: vobisque gratulamur, quod tandem

liberi inter liberos eritis.

Nam ad hunc diem flumina ac

terras et caelum quodammodo ipsum clauserant Romani, ut
conloquia congressusque nostros arcerent: vel, quod con-

tumeliosius est viris ad arma natis, inermes ac prope nudi,

sub custode et pretio coiremus.

Sed, ut amicitia societasque 3

nostra in aeternum rata sit, postulamus a vobis, muros coloniae,
munimenta servitii, detrahatis ε (etiam fera animalia, si clausa
teneas, virtutis obliviscuntur z) Romanos omnes in finibus
vestris trucidetis ; haud facile libertas et domini miscentur.

Bona interfectorum in medium cedant, ne quis occulere quic· 4
quam aut segregare causam suam possit.
que utramque ripam colere, ut olim majoribus nostris.

Liceat nobis vobis-

Quo-

modo lucem diemque omnibus hominibus, ita omnes terras V

fortibus viris natura aperuit.

to us from the English and French
names of the days of the week‚ was
already accepted. While Wuotan
or Woden was the chief god of
German devotion, Zio or Tiw (ety-
mologically the same as Ζεὺς), as
he was historically the oldest of
their gods, may have retained some
traditions of pre-eminence : the two
gods are coupled in Anu. xiii. 59.
3. But Thunar (Donner, Thor)
seems to be identified with Hercules
in Germ. l.c.‚ not, as in later times,
with Jove.

German custom of bearing arms in
popular assemblies, see Germ. 13.
1. Or. says that it was retained in

of zurich, to the end of the last
century: in the concilium of the
democratic canton of Appenzell‚ it
is said to be retained stillz—curi-
ously enough, in the Protestant and
manufacturing portion only.

premo] ‘On condition of pay-
ment '—-a modal abl. not dependent
on sub. The expression refers to

of 65. 4: a duty imposed on
marketing was a check on political
meetings, or on the country people
frequenting the town.

3 detrahatis] ‘Strip your city
of its walls‚’ C. and B. : the word
does not naturally mean ‘to pull
down.' In Ann. xv. 17. 4we have
detraheret castella trans Euphraten .·
but that is less difficult; it is as we
should say, ‘to draw off his out-
postsz’ here we have the same
image as the Homer-ic Τροίης Ζερὰ
κρήδεμνα λύωμεν (Il. xvi. 100), or
the later Greek περιαιρεῖσθαι τὸ

τεῖχος, and nearly the same as the
Latin exui castris.

4 ut oum majoribus nostris]
Tacitus tells us (Germ. 28 fin.)
that the Colony of Agrippina was
founded in well-grounded confidence
that the Ubii would prevent their
kindred from crossing the river:
presumably therefore they were ac-
customed to cross it before. He
also observes (ibid. 32) that the
Tencteri occupied the part of the
river's course where it is best fitted

for a boundary. The Rhine was
