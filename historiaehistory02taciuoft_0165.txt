monumentis] The pillars or tablets
on which it was written. Compare
Thuc. v. 56. 3, with Arnold's note.

Caesarem] He claimed the
hereditary title: the personal one
of imperator it might have been
hard to refuse to the abler and
bolder Classicus.

2 melioribus] Tacitus respects the
Germans fighting for a continuous
independence (Atm. ii. 8. 8), but
has no sympathy for a revolt of a
people who have once submitted.

Pusi Lingones] Apparently they
were not absolutely crushed by the
battle, as Frontinus ascribes their
submission to the conciliatory policy
of Domitian's advisers.

pari formidine deseruit] Plut-
arch in his Love-treatise, c. 25, tells
the story more favourably to Sa-
binus. He says that after the
defeat, he had every opportunity
for escaping to the Germans, but
would not leave his wife behind.

3 quibus artibus latebrisque]
In an underground cellar, where
his wife (aster her mourning for
him, at first sincere) visited him

every night. After an unsuccessful
visit to Rome to see if he could
obtain pardon, she lived more and
more continuously with him, and
bore him two sons in the cellar.
He was discovered in the last year
of Vespasiani, brought to Rome, and
executed with his wife. Plutarch
thinks the Emperor's death, and
the speedy extinction of his house, .
was a judgment for his cruelty:
Dio says he shed tears at the wife’s
appeal, but refused mercy. The
sons were spared——which seems
strange, as in their case Augustus'
maxim might have applied, οὐκ
ἀγαθὸν πολυκαισαρίη. To be sure,
Caesarion was really an illegitimate
son of Caesar-'s‚ which Sabinus'
grandfather was not ; but isthey were
not fornssdable, and their father was
guilty, the mother was neither.

Epponinae] Plutarch calls her
Ἐμπονὴν, ἑλληνιστὶ δ’ ἄν τις“Ηρωῖδα
προσαγορεύσειεν .· the name is no
doubt derived from the Celtic god-
dess Epona (Juv. viii. 157). Dio
writes it Pepom'la.
