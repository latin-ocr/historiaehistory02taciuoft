45 Reconciliavit paulisper studia Patrum habita in Senatu

Manlius Patruitus, Sena-

tor, pulsatum se in colonia Seniensi coetu multitudinis et
jussu Magistratuum‚ querebatur: nec finem injuriae hic
stetisse ε planctum et lamenta et supremorum imaginem prae-
senti sibi circumdata cum contumeliis et probris, quae in

Senatum universum jacerentur.

The earliest instance is
said to be Milonia Caesonia, the
last wife of Gaius. It shouldhow-
ever be remembered that we have
a Pontius Cominius in Liv. v.

gravi] Which commanded, not
so much public approval‚ as the
sincere moral approval of the Sen-
ators themselves.

damnati pulsique refers to the
time of their original condemnation,
retenti to the ratification of it now,
under the influence of Mucianus.

CH. XLV. Reconciliavit, etc]
The Senate wished to feel itsels the
supreme court of justice ‘over all
persons and in all causesz' it was
rightly ashamed of being coerced as
it had been by Nero, and desii-ed to
abolish the memory of its subservi-
ence by reprisals on his instruments.
XVhen Mucianus refused to allow a
counter-proscription‚ they felt this
as a proof that their independence
was not restored : his allowing their
sentence to remain valid in non-
political cases, οι· where their pre-
sent deliberate judgment approved
their former decision, (lid not satissy

case, involving the dignity of the
Order, and that was referred to

them for trial with all due formal-
ities3 and, ridiculous as the case
was, it was enough for them. We
scarcely know whether to say that
Tacitus has no sense of humour, or
to praise him for keeping his coun-
tenance so completely in telling
such a story.

Patruitus] The name does not
occur elsewhere, whence Lipsius
and others are inclined to read
Patruinus.

Senator] XVhen used as here and
in Anu. iii. 36. 2, as the title of a
man whom the context proves to
have been a member of the Senate,
it is explained to mean ‘a private
me1nber,' one who was not even
quaestor or quaestorius.

pulsatum] Delined by Ulpian as
an assault without bodily harm.

Seniensi] The place was no doubt
Sena (now Siena) in Etruria, not
Sena Gallica, nor Senia in Dalmatia.
But MS. authority here and in l'lin.
iii. 5. 8, is held to establish that
the anomalous form §busensis in-
stead of &utensis is used of the first-
mentioned town.

planctum . . imaginem] A
sham funeral. Some suppose that
pulsatum implies here something
beyond the technical legal lirnit
