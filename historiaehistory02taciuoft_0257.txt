“A glauce at the book will show that the Editors, remembering how {mportant it i„
that the early training should run on the same lines as the higher studoes that are to
follow, have kept steadily in view its preparatory character. They have at tlle same
time bestowed much pains on making it as clear and intelligible as possible, whllst they
have given special prominence to the laws that regulate the changes of sounfl. 'lsshe
learner's attention is also specially drawn to the stem-theory, particularly in deallng wnh
the various parts of the Verb, and their relation to each other, and in the classification of
the Irregular Verbs.'’—E:ctract from tlte Prasacc’.
