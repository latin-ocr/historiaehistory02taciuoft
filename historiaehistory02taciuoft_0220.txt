206 CORNELII TACITI

Gallias superius memoravimus, Comitabatur eum frater D.
Alpinius. Simul ceteri miseratione ac donis auxilia concibant 6
20 inter gentes periculorum avidas. Tantumque belli superfuit,
ut praesidia cohortium, alarum, legionum uno die Civilis
quadripartito invaserit, decumam legionem Arenaci, secundam
Batavoduri, et Grinnes Vadamque cohortium alarumque
castra, ita divisis copiis ut ipse et VeraX, sorore ejus genitus,
Classicusque ac Tutor suam quisque manum traherent 3 nec
omnia patrandi fiducia, sed multa ausis aliqua in parte fortu-
nam adfore: simul Cerialem neque satis cautum, et pluribus
nuntiis huc illuc cursantem, posse medio intercipi. Quibus 2
obvenerant castra decumanorum, obpugnationem legionis
arduam rati, egressum militem et caedendis materiis operatum,
turbavere, occiso praefecto castrorum, et quinque primoribus
centurionum, paucisque militibus: ceteri se munimentis

superius] iii. 35. 2, iv. 31. ι, 32.
Strictly speaking, his commission
was to Germany, but os course he
was sent through Gaul.

Cu. XX. Arenaci . . . Batavo-
dur-1 . . . Grinnes vadamque] The
first is generally supposed to be
Arnhem, the second Wyk-by-Du-
urstede; but Tacitus certainly gives
us the impression that the Romans
were still on the south of the XVaal.
Are we perhaps to understand that
it was the Lek, not the Waal, into
which Civilis diverted the waters os
the Rhine‚-so that the south-east
part of the island was already aban-
doned? Is so, the oppidum Bata·
vorum might be, not indeed Bata-
vodurum itsels, but a suburb os it
on the south side of the Lek, and
the Romans occupying it aster
Civilis' evacuation might be said to
be attacked at Batavodurum. All
four places, wherever they were,
are conjectured to have been among

sorore ejus gemtus] See on iv.
33. 1.

nec omnia patrandi fiducia] This
is the regular construction ε fiducia
takes a gen.‚ whether of a subst. or
a gerund. The infinitives adfore
and posse therefore can hardly be
said to depend on fiducia, but on a
verb meaning ‘they calculated,'to ’
be supplied from it. They are a
case of elliptical oratio obliqua like
that noted in 16. 2, 3.

2 occaso. . . centurionum] The
officers probably kept their arms,
while the men laid down theirs for
work ι hence, when the enemy
surprised them, the former fought
and were killed, while the latter
thought it no shame to fly. Or are
we to remember the paralysis of
discipline that had set in with the
civil wars, and how, with the far
less demoralised legions of the
east, Titus found it necessary to
expose his person? (see reff. on
11. 1.)
