184 CORNELII TACITI

vitisque aurea templo reperta, Liberum patrem coli, domitorem
Orientis, quidam arbitrati sunt, nequaquam congruentibus
institutis. Quippe Liber festos laetosque ritus posuit, Judae-
orum mos absurdus sordidusque.

6 Terra finesque, qua ad Orientem vergunt, Arabia terminan-
tur; a meridie Aegyptus objacet; ab occasu Phoenices et
mare; septentrionem e latere Suriae longe prospectant.

has not even an accidental resem-
blance οἵ name.

vitis aurea] Jos. Ant. xv. 11. 3,
B. J. v. 5. 4; see also Mishna,
Middoth iii. 8, translated in the
Statement os the Palestine Explora-
tion Fund sor June 1872:‘ Over the
doorway of the sanctuary was a
golden vine, supported upon the
buttresses. Every one who vowed
a leaf, or a berry, or a cluster, he
brought it and hung it upon it.'

absurdus sordidasque] The re-
ligion sostered a gloomy temper,
and the worship had no magnifi-
cence, except in the one temple,
which Tacitus of course had never
seen.

CH. VI. Arabia includes the
desert of Hauran, which no doubt
is the Arabia of Gal. i. 17. But
Tacitus’ points os the compass are
not strictly accurate; Arabia (in-
cluding Idumaea) surrounds Judaea
on the south as well as the east,
while Egypt scarcely touches it at
the south-west corner.

Phoemces et. mare] It was
scarcely possible to define how much
os the coastwas at this time Judaised,
how much in the hands os the
Phoenician (Canaanite and perhaps
Philistine) aborigines· Caesarea
was a Graeco-Roman city, Joppa
was apparently the only consider-
able town on the coast that was
Jewish, but from Acts ix. 32 sqq.
it would seem that the whole district
of Sharon was so practically.

septentrionem . . . prospectant]
‘On the side of Syria they have a
distant prospect to the north,' i.e.
it is sarther (from Jerusalem) to
their northern frontier Syria, than
in any other direction to the srontiers
above named. Or possibly we are
to take septentrionem in its primitive
sense, os the Great Bear; as we
should say ‘On the side of S yria
they havey a distant prospect ofyr¹ the
north star, '—they being so far south
that it is low in the heavens, and
seems sarther off because you look
at it almost horizontally.

2 corpora . . . laborum] The
consistent observance of the Law
surnished a perfect code os sanitary
regulations ; and Jewish practice in
the matter os eleanliness went even
beyond the requirements os Scrip-
ture or reason. On the contrary,
since the sall os the temple the Jews
have learnt to regard themselves as
chronically unclean, because acci-
dental defilements cannot be ex·
piated, and srom this cause, or from
social depression, they have become
a proverbially filthy race. Probably
the two causes reacted on each
other ; the ghettos bred epidemics,
the Jews were persecuted as poison-
ers, and crowded still more strictly
into the ghettos.

Rari imbres, uber solum] Pro-
bably therefore the present barren-
ness os Judaea is not so much due
to diminished rainfall as to neglect
os the artificial irrigation, and.
