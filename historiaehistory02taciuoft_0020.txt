inici catenas Flaviano jubet.

CORNELII TACITI

Sensit ludibrium miles, disjec-

tisque qui tribunal tuebantur, extrema vis parabatur. Opposuit 6
sinum Antonius, stricto ferro, aut militum se manibus aut
suis moriturum obtestan53 ut quemque notum et aliquo
militari decore insignem aspexerat, ad ferendam opem nomine

ciens.

Mox conversus ad signa et bellorum deos, hostium 7

potius exercitibus illum furorem, illam discordiam inicerent
orabat, donec fatisceret seditio, et, extremo jam die, sua

quisque in tentoria dilaberentur.

Profectus eadem nocte 8

Flavianus obviis Vespasiani litteris discrimini exemptus est.
Legiones, velut tabe infectae, Aponium Saturninum, Moesici
exercitus legatum, eo atrocius adgrediuntur, quod non, ut
prius, labore et opere fessae, sed medio diei exarserant,
volgatis epistolis quas Saturninus ad Vitellium scripsisse

credebatur.

Ut olim virtutis modestiaeque, tunc procacitatis 2

et petulantiae certamen erat, ne minus violenter Aponium

5 ludibrium] As in i. 45. 5, 58.
1· 47 5·

6 stricto terro . . . obtestans]
A caricature of what was a little
theatrical even in Germanicus, A nn.
1. ⁶ . .

ἐὶοὲτθ] Probably concrete, ‘de-
coration, though hardly as technical
as that has become; it does not
necessarily mean more than ‘dis-
tinction.‘

7 signa et benorum deos] 6ἓν
διὰ. δυοῖν. Cf. A. ii. 17. 2,' Or.
There live eagles are called propria
legionum numina. The native un·
hellenised parts of Roman religion
were rather setichistic than idola-
trouS, tle. sacred objects (such as the
standards) were thought to be them-
selves divine, not the symbols or the
abodes of a divinity conceived as
distinct from them.

hostium] Notice the use of the
word in the passion of a civil war, ·
contrast i. 9. 3, fin„ which shous
that in deliberate speech it would
not be so applied⁴

8 Profectus] Hardly under arrest.

obvfls V. uteris] ‘ By a letter of
Vespasian’s that met him ς’ he is
sent out to Vespasian, butan account
of the charge against him and its
futility is sent to the latter by a
quicker route, probably by sea, so
that heis able to order his release
even before he reaches him.

Cn. XI. 1 eo quod] Not men-
tioned as constituling the aggrava-
tion os the outbreak (as though they
had less to put them out of temper),
but as accounting for their greater
violence3 they had more energy to
spare for it. -

medlo diei] See oni. 62. 3.

volgans epistolis] Does Tac.
mean that there was a real letter
discovered, and Aponius' author-
ship believed? or is epistolz& quas

. credebatur equivalent to ‘a
belief· m his having written letters' Ρ

2] Tac. intends no irony, but
means seriously that the soldiers
were anxious to commend their
own loyalty by denouncing traitors.
