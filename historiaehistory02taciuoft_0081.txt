tinued in such a prosperous reign z
and, as the prosperity was for the
most part peaceable‚ that it was the
allies who aided in it. It is for-
gotten that if the (Latin) allies of
Rome contributed to any Roman
temple, it would naturally be the
federal one, of the Aventine Diana.

> Livy in fact implies that the vow of

Tarquinius was only fulfilled by his
son: the great works of Servius'
reign are the city walls and the
Aventine temple already mentioned.

5 Horatius Pulvillus iterum
consul] Livy knows nothing of this
second consulship, and assigns the
dedication of the Capitol to his first,
in the first year of the Republic:
Dionysius agrees with Tacitus. The
fact is, that the dedication of the
capital by Horatius is the beginning
of authentic Roman chronology,
perhaps of consecutive Roman his-
tory : because the Fasti Capitolini,
the annals of this temple from its
dedication, were among the few
public documents that survived the
Gallie siege. The detailed lists of
the consuls for the first two or three
years are plainly an artificial recon-
struction. The treaty with Carthage
mentioned by Polybius (iii. 22. 1)
makes Horatius the colleague in-
stead of the successor of Brutus : if
this treaty is genuine, as is probable,
the inaceuracy of the common re-
cord is proved, and even if it be a
forgery, dating from shortly before

the Third Punic VVar, it still shows
how little certainty or consistency
that record had yet attained. As to
the four or five consuls assigned to
the first year of the Republic‚ Livy
himself acknowledges the discrep-
ancy of his authorities.

ea magnificentia, etc.] An argu-
ment for accepting the traditional
account so far as to suppose that
the Capitol was substantially a
work of the regal period, after
which, whatever be the exact truth
as to Porsenna's conquest, the
wealth and power of Rome appear
to have been considerably curtailed.
Livy’s account places the dedication
the year before his attack ; that
followed by Tac., the year after;
but, even if the latter be accepted,
we might suppose that the building
was already finished.

So M. writes at sull. But the
common chronology makes the
interval 425 years; and, whatever
doubts there might be about details,
or whatever were Tacitus' own
precise views on the subject (see on
i. 1. 1), the general outline was too
well fixed to allow a difference os
ten yearS. Either Tac. made a
miscalculation‚ and never corrected
it, or an archetype of M.‚ meaning
to write the number in figures
instead of words, omitted one X.
