HISTORIARUM 111. 72. 67

in ipso aditu vice muri objecisset. Tum diversos Capitolii
aditus invadunt, juxta lucum asyli et qua Tarpeia rupes centum
gradibus aditur. Inprovisa utraque vis ,· propior atque acrior 4
per asylum ingruebat. Nec sisti poterant scandentes per
conjuncta aedificia, quae, ut in multa pace, in altum edita
solum Capitolii aequabant. Hic ambigitur, ignem tectis5
obpugnatores injecerint an obsessi, quae crebrior fama, nitentes
ac progressos depulerint. Inde lapsus ignis in porticus
adpositas aedibus 3 mox sustinentes fastigium aquilae vetere
ligno traxerunt flammam alueruntque. Sic Capitolium, clausis
'2 foribus, indefensum et indireptum conflagravit. Id facinus
post conditam urbem luctuosissimum foedissimumque rei-

. diversos] Having failed in their
attack up the clivus, nearly opposite
the Temple, they made two indepen-
dent ones on the two sides of it.
The asylum was inter duos lucos
(Liv. i. 8) in the hollow between
the two summits, and the Tarpeian
Rock beyond the temple, partly
round the corner of the hill.

4 aedificia . . . aequabant] A
house of a freedman of Claudius
was said to dwarf the temple itself‚
Juv. xiv. 91.

5 quae crebrior fama] Perhaps
from Atticus’ confession, 75. 4, per-
haps by a childish sort of pessimism,
to discredit Domitian or to grumble
against his father.

utentes . . . depulerint] Two
MSS. exhjbit the conjecture quo
nitentes . . . depellerent: the text
will mean ‘did so to thrust them
down‚' ‘thrust thern down by that
means.'

aedibus] The

Temple was three temples in one—
to Jupiter. Juno, and Minerva
(ibid. ).

aquilae] Lq. ἀετοὶ or ἀετώματα,
‘pediments‚ gables:' distinct from
fastigium, as the latter is the roof

going above and outside them.
The technical sense of the word is
so well established, that it seems
needless to suppose carved (and
gilt) wooden eagles, as some do.
‘The pediments supporting the
gable' is not intolerably harsh in
English, and the most that can be
said of the identity of fastigium and
aquila is, that it makes Tacitus’
words equivalent to these.

clausis foribus, indefensum et
indireptum] The last word proves
that the object of the clause is not
to blame the besieged for not sav-
ing it, but to state a partial con-
solation sor its fall, that it fell un-
polluted by slaughter. If we had
(complete) Tacitus’ account of the
burning of the Temple at Jerusalem,
we should be better able to judge
whether the contrast with this was
in his mind. There are. naturally,
some resemblances in the circum-
stances of the two—the conflagra-
tion of the surrounding colonnades
first, and then of the building itself.
But the Jewish temple was sar the
larger, and its court more than pro-
portionally so, so that the fire does
not appear to have spread spon·
taneously to the shrine.
