130 CORNELII TACITI

Abro-

48 Sub idem tempus L. Piso Proconsul interficitur. Ea de

Legio in
Africa auxiliaque tutandis Imperii finibus, sub D. Augusto
Tiberioque Principibus, Proconsuli parebant. Mox G. Caesar,
turbidus animi, ac M. Silanum, obtinentem Africam, metuens,
ablatam Proconsuli legionem, misso in eam rem Legato tra-

treated Galba as a legitimatc em-
peror, but both Otho and Vitellius as
usurpers. lint while acknowledging
neither, he had no need to take actu-
