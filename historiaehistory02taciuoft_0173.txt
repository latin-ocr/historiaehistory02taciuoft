num servitium et dominationem sibi concupivit, ut non eadem

fuere, donec in nostrum jus concederetis. Nos, quamquam
totiens lacessiti, jure victoriae id solum vobis addidimus, quo
pacem tueremur. Nam neque quies gentium sine armis,
neque arma sine stipendiis, neque stipendia sine tributis
haberi queunt. Cetera in communi sita sunt. Ipsi plerum· 2

Germani Britannique arceantur. Nam pulsis (quod Dii pro-

slaves, and for himself to be

CH. LXXIV. Regna] Opposed

Aen. v. 817, spumantiaque addit
Frena feris ‚· zb. vi. 90, Teucris
addita June, rather needs than
affords illustration.

latter as a race as formidable as
the former. But, except in this
