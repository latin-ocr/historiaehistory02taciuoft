concordia opibusque insignes ad exitium monstravisset.

Afri-

canus neque fateri audebat neque abnuere poterat : in Vibium

Crispum, cujus interrogationibus fatigabatur, ultro conversus,

miscendo quae defendere nequibat, societate culpae invidiam

declinavit.

Magnam eo die pietatis eloquentiaeque famam Vipstanus

Messala adeptus est, nondum senatoria aetate, ausus pro

fratre Aquilio Regulo deprecari.
rum et Orfiti domus in summum odium extulerat.

Regulum subversa Crasso-
Sponte

[ex SC.] accusationem subisse juvenis admodum, nec depel-

lendi periculi, sed in spem potentiae videbatur.

Et Sulpicia

Praetextata, Crassi uxor, quattuorque liberi, si cognosceret

Senatus, ultores aderant.

Igitur Messala non causam neque 3

Nero was in Greece. They held
command in Germany when they
were recalled by him and obliged
to kill themselves. Their names
(see i. 14. 2) were Proculus and
Rufus.

4 crispum] ii. 10. 2, 6.

miscendo, etc.] ‘By uniting
Crispus’ case with his own,' showing
that one was as bad as the other,
‘he avoided the reproach of his
crime by sharing it with another.’
Crispus was able and not unpopular,
and apparently secure from attack ε
Africanus is therefore safe, not only
from Crispus but from others, if he
can show that Crispus stands or
falls with him.

CH. XLII. Messala] iii. 9. 4,
etc.

senatoria aetate] Twenty-five.

tratre] We do not know their
parentage, but no doubt they were
really brothers, Regulus having pro-
bably changed his name by adoption.
iii. 9. 4 shows that Messala belonged
to the great family whose name
he bore.

crassorum] Piso Licinianus’ bro-
thers, i. 48. 1. Are we to under-

stand that he had been concerned
in both their deaths, or that, having
caused the death of Crassus, he
treated the whole family as enemies,
as is specified in the case of his
brutality towards Piso? (Plin. Ep.
i. 5.) Camerinus, who was certainly
prosecuted by Marcellus, may have
been Crassus' brother-indam, ii.
72. 1. Nothing, however, is known
of his death.

orfiti] Supposed to be Ser. Cor-
nelius, consul A.U.C. 804, A. D. 51.

2 ex SC. makes nonsense of the
passage, as contradicting sponte.
Two theories of its own origin are
suggested. Either some one put
ex se as a (rather barbarous) gloss
on sponte, or some early reader,
who had independent materials
(the lost conclusion of the Annals?)‚
contradicted Tacitus, saying that
Regulus had done ex SC. what he
was charged with having done
sponte. Miiller‘s sponte Caesaris
gives a possible sense, if Caesaris
accusationes can fairly mean ‘accusa-
tions brought ' (not ‘ by Caesar ’ but)
⁴ at Caesar's instance.’

depellendi perieun] Probably
