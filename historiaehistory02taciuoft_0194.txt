before noon, but that was not sast-
ing to an Oriental (see Hooker,
Eccl. l'ol. v. 72—7‚ and cs. Acts x.
10, where ἤθελε γεύσασθαι, ‘ wanted
his lunche0n‚' suggests that Peter
was not tasting, as commonly sup-
posed). On the Sabbath the Jews
made it a point os conscience to
eat three meals, holding it to be
commanded in Ex. xvi. 25. There
are twenty-eight sasts in the modern
Jewish calendar.

raptarum . . . detinetur] The
expression suggests that Tacitus
supposed the custom to be per-
manent, not confined to one week
in the year. As Jews were un-
willing to eat with strangers, there
was no opportunity sor correcting
the mistake.

4 sentuno . . . tulerit] Or.
supposes a confusion between the
weekly Sabbath and the seven days
of the Feast of Tabernacles.

dem, blandlente inertia] It is
not unlikely that the sabbatical
day was practically a much older
institution than the sabbatical year.
2 Chron. xxxvi. 21 suggests that
the law on the latter subject was a
dead letter during the whole time os
the monarchy. It is suggested
that the object of the institution
was, that, aster two rotations os a
three years' course of cropS, the
land should be allowed a year’s

sallow3 the three years’ rotation
being inferred from the law os the
tithes (Deut. xiv. 28, xxvi. 12,

Amos iv. 4) and the customary ’

period for hiring a labourer (Deut.
xv. 18, Is. xvi. 14).

the inferior MSS.

M. has com-

mearent sor the last word. Os the .

conjectural corrections proposed,
the best seems to be commetiuntur.-

But the text, though difficult‚ is g·
defensible; Or. observes that it is .

a frequent error in M. to alter an
infinitive into a finite tense by
adding a t or nl, whichever the

context makes more plausible ; >-
while it is not an uncommon thing ’-
sor Tacitus to put an infinitive in a ,

virtual oratio obliqua, without any
very clearly expressed verb to :-
govern it. Here pleraque . . . com-

meare may be taken either as ι’

co-ordinate with quod . . . feratur
or as sormally co·ordinate with
honorem . . . haberi (though of

course even then it is really de· ²
pendent on that clause), and, like ,
it, dependent on serunt, supplied ·

‘to move in their course and. ι
