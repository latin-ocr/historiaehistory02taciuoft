Batavos quoque sermones orti. ‘Non prorogandam ultra 2

Quid profectum caede et incendiis legionum, nisi ut plures

CH. XXV. 2 ab una natione]
‘One tribe‚' small, and loosely
organized. The gens Germanorum
(cf. Germ. 2. 5) might have done it,
but not the natio Batavorum.

caede etz incendiis legionum]
The capture and massaere of
Vetera. ι

3 vocent] I.q. provocent, as iv.
80. 3. Ann. vi. 34. 1, vocare ad
pugnam et detrectantem incessere.

quotam partem, ete] Cf. sup.
10. 3. Or. compares also the speech
of Agrippa in Jos. B. J. ii. 16. 4,
μόνοι δὲ ὑμεῖς ἀδοξεῖτε δουλεύειν
οἷς ὑποτέτακται τὰ πάντα, κ.τ.λ.
The parallelism between Jewish
and Batavian sentiment is not acci-
dental ; both nations revolted
because they thought they saw
providential signs (iv. 54 3) of the
dissolution of the empire; when it
appeared that the cohesion of the
empire was proof against the dis-
tractions of a war of succession,

both recognised the empire, with a
quasi-religious awe, as practically
indissoluble. True, the speech as-
signed to Agrippa is placed before
the death of Nero ; but it probably
represents rather Josephus’ own
sentiments at the time of writing
than the king's at the time of speak-
ing3 and the historian⁷s political
conduct is best accounted for by
supposing the course of his opinions
to be the same as the Batavians'.
Cf. Jos. B. J. vii. 4. 2.

4 sibi . . . indici] From the
same facts an opposite inference
had been drawn at the beginning
of the war, iv. 17. 4. Cf. Germ.
29. 2, there quoted.

5 domesticis malis] iv. 13. 1,
32. 4.

obposuisse] ‘Had staked the
ruin of the race to quit his private
sufferings,'-substantially the same
use of the word as in the technical
sense of ‘ mortgage' (Catuli. 26).

they were now 3 but the truth wasy
