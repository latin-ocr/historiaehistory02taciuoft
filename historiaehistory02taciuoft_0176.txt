162 CORNELII TACITI

pecuniamque ac dona, quis solis corrumpantur, maj0ra apud
Romanos, et neminem adeo in arma pronum, ut non idem
pretium quietis, quam periculi, malit. Quod si statim con· 4
grediantur, nullas esse Ceriali, nisi ex reliquiis Germanici
exercitus, legiones, foederibus Galliarum obstrictas. quue
ipsum, quod inconditam nuper Valentini manum contra spem
suam fuderint, alimentum illis ducique temeritatis. AusurosS
rursus venturosque in manus, non inperiti adulescentuli, verba
et contiones, quarn ferrum et arma, meditantis, sed Civilis et
Classici: quos ubi aspexerint, redituram in animos formi-

que. Pars montibus, alii viam inter Mosellamque flumen,

qula sons corrumpantur] ‘The

colleagues, and succeeds with his

redituram . . . vitam] They
would remember ( 1) what defeats
they sustained and what sufferings
they endured before they had sur·
