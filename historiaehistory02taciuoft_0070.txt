58 CORNELII TACITI

nuntiis salutem et pecuniam et secreta Campaniae offerre
Vitellio, si, positis armis, seque ac liberos suos Vespasiano
permisisset. In eundern modum et Mucianus composuit4
quibus plerumque fidere Vitellius, ac de numero
servorum, electione litorum, loqui. Tanta torpedo invaserat
animum ut, si principem eum fuisse ceteri non meminissent, ipse
64 oblivisceretur. At primores civitatis Flavium Sabinum, prae
sectum urbis, secretis sermonibus incitabant, victoriae famae-
que partem capesseret. Esse illi proprium militem cohortium, ’
urbanarum, nec defuturas vigilum cohortes, servitia ipsorum,
fortunam partium, et omnia prona victoribus. Ne Antonio 2
Varoque de gloria concederet. Paucas Vitellio cohortes,
et maestis undique nuntiis trepidas 3 populi mobilem animum,
et si ducem se praebuisset, easdem illas adulationes pro
Vespasiano sore. Ipsum Vitellium ne prosperis quidem3⁸

3 salutem] Cf. i. 74 r.

secreta. campaniae] Cf. secretum
Asiae in i. 10. 2.

4 torpedo] Or. understands this
of his stupidity in thinking such

mander (cf. i. 46. 2) seem to have
been discharged like the Praeto-
nans.

visuum cohortes] Their duties
seem to have been rather those of

promises would be kept : but trust-

his family. Rather it refers to the
sluggish nature, that held lise worth

and Vespasian wouldphave‚ that
such a lise as an emperor could
secure him would satissy Vitellius'
desires as well as being emperor
himself.

Cn. LXIV. 1 capesseret] Not
a final clause with ut omitted, but
an imperative thrown into oratio
obliqua.

cohortium urbanarum] 4000
men, ii. 93. 3. Yet these were old
Vitellian troops: the older cohorts,
which no doubt would have been
personally attached to their com-

police than soldiers, but they had a
quasi-military organisation and dis-
cipline that made them available sor
military service within the city.
ipsorum] Os his advisers, the
primores civitam. Sua would have
been ambiguous, naturally referring

to illi, the virtual subject of this ’

sentence.

omma prom. v10tor1bus] Ex-
actly parallel in constr. to nihil
arduum finis in ii. 82. 5.

2 Paucas] Three, says On, refer·
ring to 78. 4. But though these
were all engaged at the Capitol, a
larger soree os regulars seems im-
plied in 69. 1, 82. 3. The three
cohorts of 78. 4 are perhaps Prae·
torians ; two were lest at Rome (55.
2), and one may have returned
thither with Vitellius himself.
