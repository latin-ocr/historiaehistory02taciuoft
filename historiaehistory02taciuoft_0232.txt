218 CORNELII TACITI

4. Cum lamen cas (sc. sani pertas) ab ipso Vespasiano post
annum apertas Cornelius Tacitus prodat.—-Id. vii. 19.
we do not know what was the war arising in ΑΛ). 73 or 74 that

appeared to Vespasian to call sor this solemn reopening. Probably it was
some inconsiderable frontier fighting, leading, however, to extension os

the empire in Britain (see Agr. 17), and perhaps equally petty and more ,

resultless operations in Africa, as Juvenal (xiv. 196) couples Maurorum
attegias, castella Brtgrantum, as the only material available sor an aspirant

to military same.

5. Nam quanta suerint Diurpanei, Dacorum regis, cum
Fusco duce praelia, quantaeque Romanorum clades, longo
textu evolverem, nisi Cornelius Tacitus, qui hanc historiam
diligentissime contexuit, ‘de reticendo interfectorum numero
et Sallustium Crispum et alios quam plurimos auctores

sanxisse, et' se ipsum ‘idem potissimum elegisse’ dixisset.
ld. vii. 10.

mur-pauet] Our other authorities
call the Dacian king who carried on
war against Domitian, Decebalus‚
as also the king conquered by
Trajan. The two may or may not

Dacians‚’ and Diurpaneus the
personal name os the Decebalus
contemporary with Domitian.

Fusco] See ii. 86. 5 n, etc.

de reticendo . . . sanxisse]
This construction is not unlikely to
have proceeded srom Tacitus. Lege
sanare de re is not unusual Latin,

agr. Liv. xxxiv. 4; the omission of
l ge is within the limits of Tacitean
eccentricity.

Sauusttum crispum] Probably
in his llislaries, but not found
among the extant remains.

6. Caesi itaque, morum elogio in filiis derelicto.

FULGENTws‚ c. 7.

Quoted by the grammarian Fulgentius as srom ‘Cornelius Tacitus in

libro facetiarum. ’

Almost certainly this does not mean that Tacitus com·

piled a jest-book ; whether it means that a collection was made of Tacitus’

witty sayings, or that in a collection os witty sayings some were inserted
of his, is less certain. The notices we have os Cicero's ἀποφθέγματα, of
which a collection was made in his own lifetime by Trebonius (Cic. ad
sam. xv. 21. 1, 2), and a posthumous one by Tiro, may incline us to the

former view; on the other hand, caesar (id. ib. ix. 16. 4) seems to have ’
