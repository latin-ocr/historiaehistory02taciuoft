HISTORIARUM 111. 3. 3

Quid tum claustra montium profutural quid tractum in5

aestatem aliam bellum? unde interim pecuniam et commeatus?
Quin potius eo ipso uterentur, quod Pannonicae legiones, 6
deceptae magis quam victae, resurgere in ultionem properent,

Moesici exercitus integras vires attulerint. Si numerus militum 7

potius quam legionum putetur, plus hinc roboris, nihil libi-
dinum 3 et profuisse disciplinae ipsum pudorem. Equites
vero ne tum quidem victos, sed quamquam rebus adversis

disjectam Vitellii aciem.

‘Duae tunc Pannonicae ac Moesi· 8

cae alae perrupere hostem: nunc sedecim alarum conjuncta
signa pulsu sonituque et nube ipsa operient ac superfundent

oblitos praeliorum equites equosque.

suasor auctorque consilii ero.

Nisi quis retinet, idem

Vos, quibus fortuna in integro 9

est, legiones continete: mihi expeditae cohortes sufficient.

Jam reseratam Italiam, inpulsas Vitellii res audietis.
3 sequi et vestigiis vincentis insistere.'

the adjectival form, though semi-
poetical (Virg. Aen. i. 243), is not
the less Tacitean.

6 eo ipso . . . quod . . . pro-
perent] Their haste must be met
with haste, or the first passion of
their indignation will have spent
itself.

7 legionum] Those on the Vitel-
lian side had left at least a depOt-
battalion in Germany.

putetur] No other instance is
quoted later than Cato of this use
of the simple verb in the same sense
as computo.

pudorem] Hardly so much as
‘humiliation' (C. and R), because
it denotes an emotion, not a mis-
sortune‚ though it is less ἐξ ὑποθέσεως
(Ar. Etlc. iv. 9. 7), than in its com-
mon use, where one translates it
‘ military honour.’

7, 8 Equites . .
42 44· 4·

8 Pannonicae ac Moesicae] Raised
indiscriminately from the two con-
terminous provinces.

. hostem] ii. 41.

Juvabit
Haec ac talia flagrans

nube ipsa] Of dust3 it seems
hardly Latin to talk as we do of ⁶ a
cloud of cavalry.' oblitos is pro-
bably proleptic.

suasor auctorque] ‘ 1 will make
myself responsible for the policy 1
recommend‚' zze. I will act on
it with or without the leave of
others„

9 quibus fortuna in integro est]
‘A'ondum adversa m forta nam experti,
ut Bedriaci Othoniani, quijam Ves-

pasiano accessemnl, ii. 86' (Ι. 2),

Or. But the antithesis is between
vos and mihi, and Antonius (Le.)
had not fought for Otho. He must
mean, ‘ As you have not committed
yourselves, you need not now. I '
(the desperate com-iet, Tac. thinks,
though Antonius does not say) ⁶ will
not shrink from decisive action on
my own account.

Italiam] A correction sor υιῐίῐίιάηι
—which would be a strange phrase,
but perhaps not too strange sor Tac.
It would have to mean more than
