makes the charges less confidently
than in i. 66. 6, but intimates that
there was everything to make them
credible. The last temptation is
that which Otho elaims credit for
resisting, ii. 47. 2.

3 avidos periculorum] Like the
Flavians, 26. 2. They would have
been glad to fight then and there isan
enemy had been present, but, being
‘ past minding disgrace‚’ they could
not be trusted for a fatiguing march.

4 cohortes . . . jubet: ipse flexit]
Notice that the abl. abs, paucis . . .
comitantibus, though put before the
first clause, belong in sense to the
second, for of course it is meant
that the pauci accompanied Valens,
not the cohortes. It is unnecessary
either to transpose the clause, or to
interpret paucis quos . . . comitanti-
bus as = cu [πρᾶτα-ἱ comitantium essent
quos, ete. In Greek the two prin-
cipal clauses would be marked by
μὲν and δὲ, and in that language it
is familiar for a dependent clause
to refer to the second only.

111 Umbriam] Not, as some com-
mentators approved by Or. under-
stand it, still following the middle
course, but the one which would
have been wisest if adopted in time ;
only he now (42. 2) had to go farther
west to be safe. The next clause
implies that his latent energy and
ability were at last aroused.

provenisset] The subject is no
doubt consilium, though in Plautus
the word is occasionally used of
persons, ‘ to prosper (well or ill).'

exercitus et Germaniae gentes]
Being ignorant that they were
already at war with each other. It
was, however, quite possible that
the troops, still attached to Vitellius
(iv. 27. 4, 31. 4), would have been
able to secure native allies if they
had had a competent and trusted
leader, and could have shown them
another enemy worth plundering.
