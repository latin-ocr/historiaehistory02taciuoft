in the moral sense of courageous
free-speaking, in assailing a fallen
enemy, and so it was the reverse of
liberale to do so.

3 debello civium] We have the
same phrase below, 72. 3, sor the
commoner bellum civile: doubtless it
is only the fact that that phrase is
commoner, that made M. write
civilium. In the earlier civil wars,
the principle that they afforded no
triumphs (Lucan, i. 12) had been
evaded with more plausibility than
now: because the victories of
Thapsus, perhaps of Munda, and
certainly of Actium, had been gained
not over a domestic enemy only, but
his foreign allies. Here the Sarma-
tian expedition (the events of iii. 46
interpreted in the light of those of
i. 79) was so slight an affair that the
pretext was transparent.

4 Mox] After more important
persons, such as emperors, courtiers,
and military adventurers, had all
received their due.

Asiaticus, consul designatus]
The consul ‹lm-gnatus was, according

to republican precedent, always first
asked for his smtentia. Asiaticus
was moreover anxious to make him-
self prominent in the acceptance of
Vespasian, lest he should be de-
prived of his office as a partisan and
son-in-law of Vitellius, i. 59. 4
manu] Here, coupled with voltu,
it seems most natural to understand
this of clapping: sometimes how-
ever it is clearly of voting by show
of hands, as distinguished from
pedibus (division) and voce (speech).
5 ut honorificam . . . falsa
aberant] A harsh variation of the
construction ut honorificam . .
ita α quafczlsa aberant. But it seems
needless to assume a lacuna.
praecipuus] Virtually an adv.
mag-nae offensae] He did avoid
extravaganee in eompliment to Ves-
pasian, and, we must suppose, was
reported to him as having spoken
in a disaffected tone. It is generally
held, from our scanty notices, that
it was only by studiously offensive
language that he provoked Vespasian
into ordering his exile and death.
