2 CORNELII TACITI

Superesse Vespasiano mare, classes, studia provinciarum,

per quas velut alterius belli molem cieret.

Ita salubri mora

larly distinguished in construction3
the most literal almost always takes
the dat., the derivative ‘to adhere
t0,’ the dat., or in, in proportion
as the use is physical or figurative, ·
while this transitive one is almost
peculiar to the cases os a town or
an army ‘occupying’ a position.
Of course here the soree os the abl.
abs. is conditional—‘ it, in the in-
terval, they occupied.'

Superesse] Either ‘he has in ad-
dition’ to our forces and those of
Mucianus, or ‘he has not lost, and
holds in reserve’ the advantages οἵ
his geographical and moral position.

praesentssms] A dative, ‘from
their forces on the spot)

CH. 11. 1 conc1tor or conc1tator]
Alternative conjectures, as M„ hesi-
tating which to write, put concz'ator.
Hence tuo or three MSS. and early
edd. give barbarously concionator,
as though that could mean ‘the
adv ocate’ or,as w e say, ‘the preacher
of the war.' Of the two admissible
forms, that in the text is most fre-
quent in Tac., ag. iv. 56. 341

2 se egerint] This construction
is found, though rarely, in the silver
age sor agere or se gerere, e.g. Sen.
de Ben. ii. 20.

3 amoemtate urbis] Amoenus,
a hals romantic word (see on i. 67.
4), is rare os town attractions3 see,
however, Ann. v. 2. 1.

valetudinibus] ‘ By sickness ;'
drffiv‘ent causes assecting the health.
One would not use the pl. in a
merely distributive sense—‘ in their
healths' would hardly be natural,
even in English. Cf. Ann. vi. 30.
3, where the pl. is used of a single
perSOss.

meditattone belu] Not so much
‘the preparation sor war ' (C. and Β.)
as ‘the practice’ which the earlier
stages of war supply sor the more
advanced. See iv. 26. 3, for a
specification of the belli meditamenta.

4 utrmque] Probably from Gaul
and Spain3 Germany and Britain
are conceived less as sources os
possible forces than as the bases of
their actual ones.

myrteum mare] AL Illyrici, but
