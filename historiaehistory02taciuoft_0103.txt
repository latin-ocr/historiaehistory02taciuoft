HISTORIARUM IV. 8. 91

tuta exolescerent, aut principis honor in cujusquam contume-
liam verteretur 3 sufficere omnes obsequio. Id magis vitandum,

ne pervicacia quorumdam inritaretur animus novo principatu

suspensus, et voltus quoque ac sermones omnium circum-

spectans.

Se meminisse temporum quibus natus sit, quam 3

civitatis formam patres avique instituerint3 ulteriora mirari,

praesentia sequi 3 bonos imperatores voto expetere, quales-

cunque tolerare.

Non magis sua oratione Thraseam quam 4

judicio senatus adflictum: saevitiam Neronis per ejusmodi

imagines inlusisse, nec minus sibi anxiam talem amicitiam

quam aliis exsilium. Denique constantia, fortitudine, Catoni· 5

bus et Brutis aequaretur Helvidius: se unum esse ex illo

· senatu qui simul servierit.

Suadere etiam Prisco ne supra

principem scanderet, ne Vespasianum senem triumphalem,

juvenum liberorum patrem, praeceptis coerceret.

i. 19. 2, 3; which, however, is not
a very relevant precedent, since the
Senate refused to abide by the result
of the lot.

2 sufficere omnes obsequio] Any-
body was competent sor a mere
service of courtesy.

3 patres amque] ‘The last two
generations,' the century since the
establishment of the empire, or per-
haps rather the fifty-eight years since
it was avowed to be a permanent, not
a personal, office, by the association
of Tiberius with Augustus. Palm
is never, and avi never in prose,
used in the general sense of ‘fore-
fathers ;' here, moreover, it is limited
to the litera] sense by apposition to
ulteriora.

4 Non magis . . .
‘His speech was no more the real
cause of Thrasea’s ruin than was
the judgment of the Senate; both
were masks under which N ero's

adflictum]

cruelty disported itself5' he gives

up Thrasea's death as indefensible,

but extenuates his own share in it.
aliis] He means to Helvidius

Quomodo 6

himself. He had saved his lise and
residence at Rome by taking part
in Thrasea’s death3 Helvidius' life
had been spared, and being away
from Rome he had a better chance
that it would continue to be.

5 catonibus et Brutis] For the
sentiment cf. Juv. iv. 74. The
conciliatory poliey of Augustus had
left it open to any one to make a
hero of Cato, or even Pompey, and
a generation or two later Brutus
might be conceived as likewise a
hero of the republic, instead of a
traitor to the empire. But we
should want more proof than the
obiter dictmn of Juvenal (v. 36) to
establish that not only Helvidius,
but his moderate and sensible father-
in-law, were aecustomed to keep
solemn festivals in honour of the
tyrannicideS.

unum] See on iii. 70. 5.

servierit] The perfect is retained
from the oratio recta.

scanderet] Scarcely used else-
where, says Orelli, in this nieta-
phorical sense.
