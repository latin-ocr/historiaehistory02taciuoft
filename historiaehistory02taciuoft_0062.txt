5ο CORNELII TACITI

suumque animum professus, ut cuncta viseret, postulat. Missi

Agrestis ad Vitellium remeavit, abnuentique vera esse 6⁴
quae adferret, atque ultro corruptum arguenti, ‘Quandoqui-
dem‚’ inquit, ‘magno documento opus est, nec alius jam tibi
aut vitae aut mortis meae usus, dabo cui credas! Atque ita 7
digressus voluntaria morte dicta firmavit. Quidam jussu
Vitellii interfectum, de fide constantiaque eadem tradidere.
55 Vitellius, ut e somno excitus, Julium Priscum et Alfenium
Varum curn quattuordecim praetoriis cohortibus et omnibus
equiturn alis obsidere Apenninum jubet. Secuta e classicis
legio. Tot milia armatorum, lecta equis virisque, si dux

‘the emperor’s charge, and his own
sincere zeal in executing it.'

7 dieta firmavit] The confirma-
tion was, that he was indifferent to
his own interest, apart from his

to a modern, that a man could not
be supposed to lie on the eve os
death, or that his loyalty being
doubted made life insupportable.

amittere means, according to
On, a permanent abolition of the
tribute, while remittere would only

Certainly remittere in . . . annos (in
