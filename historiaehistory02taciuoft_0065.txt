HISTORIARUM 111. 58. 5 3

cum praefectis praetorii relicta, L. Vitellium fratrem, cum
sex cohortibus et quingentis equitibus, ingruenti per Cam-
paniam bello opposuit. Ipse, aeger animi, studiis militum 2
et clamoribus populi arma poscentis, refovebatur, dum volgus
ignavum, et nihil ultra verba ausurum, falsa specie exercitum
et legiones appellat. Hortantibus libertis (nam amicorum3
ejus quanto quis clarior, minus fidus,) vocari tribus jubet,
dantes nomina sacramento adigit.
curam delectus in consules partitur. Servorum numerum et
pondus argenti senatoribus indicit. Equites Romani obtulere 4
operam pecuniasque, etiarn libertinis idem munus ultro flagi-
tantibus. Ea simulatio officii a metu profecta verterat in
favorem; ac plerique hau-d perinde Vitellium quarn casum
locumque principatus miserabantur.

liant success ; he did not venture to
allow the main army out of his own
reach, and, being incompetent to
command it, tried to raise a reserve.

senators. It can scarcely mean
⁴ personal service. '

verterat 111 favorem] Hardly
‘had changed into enthusiasm '—
favor is no more than ‘ popularity‚'
only conceived on the active not the

delectus] It is curious that these
bits of pedantic antiquarianism are
ascribed to freedmen, they har-
monise so well with what we have
often noticed of Vitellius’ own pseu-
do-republicanism. Perhaps that
r61e was suggested to him (cs. ii.
91. 5, mitigantibus amicis) by a
freedman cleverer than himself,
though adopted by him with too
much vanity to be dishonest. The
old-sashioned civic levies had been
virtually obsolete, not only since the
riseof a standing armyunder Marius,
but from the establishment of Roman
supremaey, by the overthrow os
Carthage, Macedon, and Syria.

4 operam] ‘Labour⁷——they also
furnished slaves and money, like the

passive side. The meaning is, that
individuals readily yielded to Vit-
ellius' requisitions from fear τ others,
who saw their conduct but not
their real motives, caught the con-
tagion of their supposed motives,
and imitated their conduct.

5 deerat] C. inf.‚ as often from
i. 36. 3 onwards.

aspernatus antea] i. 62. 4, ii. 62.
3. Voluit perhaps does not imply
that he actually assumed the title:
there is no trace of it on his coins,
which probably would be struck, if
anything‚ in increasing numbers.
Perhaps the Senate showed itsels in
no hurry to vote it, and it may be in-
cluded in quae non dabantur remisil.

superstitione nominis] From
