Cir. IV. contrariosque ceteris
mortalibus] The remark was an
old one,—Esth. iii. 8. St. Paul
apparently takes it up as proverbial
, and not unjust, in 1 Thess ii. 15.
Prosana . . . incesta is only a half
malicious and half rhetorical over-
statement of it ; compare, however,

2 Effigiem animalis] According
to one version preserved by Plu-
tarch, ,the figure was of Moses
riding on an ass, which can be only
an Egyptian invention. It is
generally thought that the com-
moner story, describing the Jew’s
idol as an ass’s head, arose from
the figures that really were in the
sanctuary ; the cherubim had their
faces inward (2 Chron. iii. 13), and
either a kneeling human figure or a
conchant sphinx or griffin with out-
stretehed wings would look some-
thing like an ass‘s head, when seen
from behind. Tertullian (Apol. 16)
taunts Tacitus with the inconsis-
tency between this passage and
9. 1; it is possible that, though
the second temple was without
cherubim, pictures were made by
lax Jews showing what the interior
ought to look like.

The charge of worshipping the
ass’s head was transferred from the
Jews to the Christians ; see Ter-
tullian l. c. and the well-known
caricature of Alexamenus from the
Palatine. Tertullian's description
of the drawing of ‘the Christian's

god, Ononychites’ (or some such
name), is thought by some to
suggest that there was really some
monstrous oriental divinity, whom
Jews and Christians were supposed
to worship, as they worshipped no
other. See Merivale, Romans under
Empire, vol. vii. pp. 216-217 n.

caeso ariete, etc] The allusion
may be to the initiatory sacrifices
of Levit. viii. 14, 19, 23, which,
however, are for the consecration
of the priests, not of the temple.
It seems strange that sacrifices so
common should be thought to need
accounting for.

3 merito cladis ete.] There is
of course a real danger in eating
measly pork, and it is not unlikely
that the Mosaic prohibition was a
consecration of a sanitary rule.

crebris . . . jejuniis] One
(Levit. xvi. 29, etc.) obligatory by
the law, four more (Zech. viii. 19)
by custom dating from the capti-
vity and commemorating it, and
several others of later origin. The
fasts on Monday and Thursday
(St. Luke xviii. 12) were supposed
to be connected with the time of
giving the law; they seem not to
have been universally observed ; but
on the other hand, Judith viii. 6 and
St. Luke ii. 37 seem to show that
some individuals went further.
There was a mistaken impression
(Augustus, ap. Suet. Aug. 76)
that they sasted on the Sabbath,
when apparently they did not eat
