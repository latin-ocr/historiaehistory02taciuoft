The fact that he had brought the
prophetess with him is credible and
interesting.

Cn. LXVIII. 1 Num tale vide·
rant] In the deaths of Nero, of
Galba and Piso, and perhaps of
Gaius; nihil audierant-in that of
the Dictator Caesar.

2 Repenttna vis . . . occultae
insidiae] The antithesis is between
an assassination effected in a public
place by surprise and one out of
sight; for the first had been pre-
concerted at least as long as the
second.

ignotum rus] The villa of the
freedman Phaon.

tamquam tn acie] As a cohort
with its standards accompanied
them, though only one man seems
to have fought, i. 41, 1, 43. 1. In
describing the latest event, he
changes from the plu-pf. used in
alluding to the others.

3 In sua contione] The contio
or public niceting was an innovation
on the old constitutional comitia,

but the Romans never seem to have
got so far as to conceive of such a
meeting being called and addressed
by other than a recognised official,
a tribune at least. Hence, under
the empire, they (without any formal
measure os repression being needed)
are only summoned by the emperor,
and are naturally called his.

congruentia] Notice that with
all his grossness and incapacsty, he
seems not to have been wanting in
the essentia] Roman faculty of ready
and effective public speaking.

innoxiam liberorum aetatem]
He had one daughter just married,
i. 59. 4, and one nubilis, 78. 2, but
they would probably both be under
sixteen, and beneath suspicion of
political intrigues. Germanicus was
a mere baby.

Simplex] ii. 60. 5. Where was
Atticus, who would doubtless (73. 4)
have taken it?

puglonem] The μάχαιρα of St.
Paul (Rom. xiii. 4); see on i. 43.
1.
