138 CORNELII TACITI

Otho to their own homes, there to
oppose Vitellius, (2) Gallie chiefs
summoned by Otho from their
homes to the seat of war against
Vitellius, (3) Gauls among the
senators sent by Otho (i. 74. 3) to
meet Vitellius. (1) is certainly the
most natural interpretation of the
words as they stand, though hardest
to fit into the history.

Cn. LV. Classicumque] ii. 14. 2.

e majoribus . . . jactabat] Tacitus
has here accumulated three eccentri-
cities of construction: e majoribus
in the sense of ‘jam indeo m.,’ the
omission (very frequent with him)
of polius before quam, and the ultra-
Grecism of hostis jactabat sor se
hostem jactabat. To avoid the first
and last, some take hostis as an acc.
pL, correcting socios to match—⁸ those
of his ancestors who had been ene·
mies. rather than those who had been
allies) The Treveri had not been
more desperate enemies to Caesar

than the rest of the Gauls; but
Classicus may well have been de-
seended from a chief, perhaps Indu·
tiomarus, who had distinguished him-
self in the war, and never submitted.

2 Ltngonus] Though the pl. is
always Lingones, this form of the
sing. is found'also in Mart. viii. 75.
2, and in an inser.

ripae . . . praefectus] Probably
a sort of coast-guard officer—not
having a jurisdiction independent of
the Legates os Upper and Lower
Germany.

proavlam . . .
exeg. of salsae stirpis gloria.
Proavia is to be understood literal-
ly, though the word does not
suggest the same ludicrous idea as
the English translation.

3 ln coloma] The word colonia
is treated in constr. as still an appel-
lative, though ColoniaAgraeppinensis
is practically a pr. n.

umorum] The native name of

placuisse] Ep-
