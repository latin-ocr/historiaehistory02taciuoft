HISTORIARUM 111. 74. 71

quos maxime insignes Cornelius Martialis, Aemilius Pacensis,
Casperius Niger, Didius Scaeva, pugnam ausi obtruncantur.

Flavium Sabinum inermem neque fugam coeptantem circum· 4

sistunt, et Quintium Atticum consulem, umbra honoris et

suamet vanitate monstratum, quod edicta in populum, pro

Vespasiano magnifica, probrosa adversus Vitellium jecerat.
Ceteri per varios casus elapsi, quidam servili habitu, alii fide 5

clientium contecti et inter sarcinas abditi.

Domitianus

prima inruptione apud aedituum occultatus, sollertia liberti
lineo amictu turbae sacricolarum inmixtus ignoratusque, apud

Cornelium Primum, paternum clientem, juxta Velabrum

delituit.

Ac potiente rerum patre disjecto aeditui contu-2

bernio, modicum sacellum Jovi Conservatori aramque posuit

casus suos in marmore expressam, mox imperium adeptus

deprived of his office aster it (A nn.
xv. 71. 5), which suggests that he
was a sober anti-imperialist. For
Pacensis see above, i. 20. 5, 87. 2,

pears honourably in Ann. xii. 45
sq.‚ xv. 5. 2 3 but Scaeva can
hardly be the A. Didius who had
commanded in Britain, and if not,
is entirely unknown to us.

4 umbra honoris] He had the
consular insignia about him.

suamet vanitate, quod . . .
jecerat] He had tried to assume
the position of a leading Flavian
partisan by issuing (probably the
day before the siege) a proclamation
as consul in that interest, and had
succeeded in getting men's eyes
upon him.

5 audaciam pro latebra] Sug-
gested by Sall. Cat. 58, audacia pro
muro.

CH. LXXIV. lineo . . . sac-
ricolarum] Suetonius says he es-
caped in the disguise of a priest of

Isis. This agrees with Tac„ as the
Egyptian priests wore only linen;
Hdt. ii. 37, Ov. Met. i. 747, Juv.
Vl. 533.

2 disjecto aeditui contubernio]
Perhaps there is some sarcasm here.
The unprincipled bigot was full of
gratitude to the god who had taken
better care of him than of himself,
but turned out of doors the man
whose part in his deliverance was
much less questionable. It would,
however, have been so easy to com-
pensate the aedituus for his loss that
we cannot be sure it was not done.
For contubernium, cf. i. 43. 2.

Jovi conservatori . . . custodi]
Both titles are found in an inscrip-
tion, and on coins of Domitian.
The earlier seems to be meant as a
translation of Ζεὺς Σώτηρε cf. Ann.
xv. 71. 3, Conservalorz's sibi nomen,
Graeco ‘jus rei vocabulo, adsumpsit.
Cicero (Vcrr. ΙΙ. ii. 63. 154) con·
sidered Σώτηρ untranslatable.

casus suos . . . expressam] A
Graecism scarcely elsewhere found
