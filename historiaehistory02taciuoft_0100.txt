88 CORNELII TACITI

.-

ῡ Res poscere videtur, quia iteruin in mentionem incidimus
viri saepius memorandi, ut vitam studiaque ejus, et quali
fortuna sit usus, paucis repetam. Helvidius Priscus †regione 2
Italiae, Carecinae municipio, Cluvio patre, qui ordinem
primipili duxisset,† ingenium inlustre altioribus studiis juvenis
admodum dedit, non ut plerique, ut nomine magnifico segne
otium velaret, sed quo firmior adversus fortuita rempublicam
capesseret. Doctores sapientiae secutus est qui sola bona 3
quae honesta, mala tanturn quae turpia, potentiam, nobilita—
tem, ceteraque extra animum, neque bonis neque malis

have owed the name he is known
by to his adoption by the legatus
lqgrionis of Ann. xii. 49. 3; is that
had been his own father, we could

CH. V. lterum] The former
mention being ii. 9¹· 4

saepius] After this day's debate,
we hear of him again in the Senate‚

43. 1, and at the restoration of the
Capitol, 53. 3. But the chief re-
ference is doubtless to the account
of his quarrel with the emperor,
which must have been related in the

lost books.
2 regione Italiae, caree1nae

municipio] Geographers mention a
Samnite tribe, the Caraceni, Cari-
cini, or Carcini, about Aufidena:
their territory might be called
Carecina, and described by a correct
gloss as a regio ltaliae, but not by
Tacitus himself as a municzpz'um.
The correction Tarracina muni-
cipio is improbable—no copyist
would have substituted the obscure
name Carecina for one which has
occurred so often in the last few
chapters. It is probable that regione
ltaliae is an interpolation, and cer-
tain that there is some corruption
of the text.

Cluvio patre] M. has Cluvios,
which perhaps lends a little support
to the conjecture that the name of
the municipium is disguised under
this word. But it is os course pos-
sible that Helvidius may have been
the son ot a Cluvius (perhaps a
relation os the celebrated Rufus,
whom the son admired, 43. ι), and

not have heard os the ordo pri-
mtjpz'li here, as his highest distinc-
tion.

duxisset] No good reason can
be assigned for the conjunctive, and
probably the corruption of the text
extends as sar as this word.

ut plerique] Compare the view
of philosophy taken by Agricola in
his mature years, Agr. 4 4, 5. It
was the old traditional Roman view
(Enn. ap. Cic. Tusa, initu), and
indeed older than the introduction
of philosophy at Rome (plat. Rep.
vi. p. 487), that devotion to philo-
sophy implied incapacity or distaste
sor the duties os practical lise; the
Roman Stoics os this age had not
yet worked themselves clear from
the imputation.

3 sapientiae] A technical term,
as a translation of σοφία (Enn. Α nn.
i. 15), but in practice used rather
as equivalent to φιλοσοφία.

sola . . . tantum] Notiee the
arbitrary and merely verbal varia-
tion.

neque bonis neque mans] Taci-
tus' purity of language is too scrupu-
lous to use, as Seneca had done,
z'ndzfferens as a translation of ἀδιοί-

φορος.
