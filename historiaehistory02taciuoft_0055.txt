Fonteius Agrippa ex Asia (pro consule eam pro-5

vinciam annuo imperio tenuerat,) Moesiae praepositus est,
additis copiis e Vitelliano exercitu, quem spargi per provincias

nationes silebant.

Anicetus, Polemonis libertus, praepotens olim, et, postquam
regnum in formam provinciae verterat, mutationis inpatiens.
Igitur Vitellii nomine adscitis gentibus quae Pontum adcolunt, 2
corrupto in spem rapinarum egentissimo quoque, haud tem-
nendae manus ductor, Trapezuntem vetusta fama civitatem, a
Graecis in extremo Ponticae orae conditam, subitus inrupit.
Caesa ibi cohors, regium auxilium olim, mox donati civitate 3
Romana signa armaque in nostrum modum, desidiam licenti-

amque Graecorum retinebant.

4 et quod . . . transegimus]
Virtually co-ordinate with quae . . .
tulit: the fortune of Rome appeared
in two things, that the army was
there, and that it was not wanted
elsewhere. Or. takes transegimus
absolutely as i.q. rem corzfi’cimus,
comparing ii. 38. 6, iii. 5. 6, where
however it is not used absolutely.
If he be right, as is most likely, we
must understand, ‘We‚ the Roman
people, had settled our dynastic pro-
blem‚' not ‘ We, the Flavian party,
had decided the campaign in our fav-
our,' for Tac. does not identify him-
sels with that party, though his father-
in-law had (Agr. 7. 2). But with
this translation we should have ex-
pected the plu. -pf. , though the aorist
would doubtless have been used in
Greek : and it would be possible to
translate quod . . . transegimus,
‘ and the intervening event at Cre-
mona which we (the author) have
disposed of [as a painful subjeet].’

CH. XLVII. 1 regiae] Of Polemo
mentioned in the next line, the last

king of Pontus, who ceded his king-
dom to Rome, A.D. 63. He had
turned Jew to get Berenice to marry
him: when she deserted him, he
not unnaturally recanted.

2 Trapezuntem] See Xen. Anah.
iv. 8. 22, etc.

Ponticae orae] Of the kingdom
of Pontus—it was not absolutely
the easternmost Greek colony in the
Euxine. But Trapezus was a much
more considerable place than Dios-
curias, and Tac. may have for-gotten
the existence of the latter.

3 regium auxilium] A part of
the auxilia furnished by the king to
Rome. The Greek troops would,
however, stand in the relation of
auxilia to the native Pontio army
—if there was one—as the kingdom
was not Greek. The old royal family
of the Mithridatae was Persian ;
but Polemo was remotely isat all
connected with it.
