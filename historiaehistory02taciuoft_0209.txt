per arbem obliqui] Not carried
in a straight line over level ground
that allowed os it, but so that the
natural line of attack, even where
attack was possible, might fall at an
oblique angle to the wall. Or.
quotes Veget- iv. 2, ambitum muri
directum veteres duci noluerunt, ne
ad ictus arietum esset dispositus:
Vegetius then proceeds to explain
the advantage of the walls being
introrsus sinuati (‘with re-entering
angles') ut latera . . . pamm-ent.

introrsus sinuati] The outer
wall of Agrippa had ninety towers,
which projected twenty feet from it,
nodoubt enough for them to serve the
purpose of bastions‚—z'.e. securing
within the range of arrows, or even
of ballistae, the power of cross—fire
that modern bastions secure within
cannon-shot. But perhaps Tacitus
rather refers (as above suggested)
to the impregnable fortifications on
the south than to the strong ones on
the north: and then the reference
will be chiefly to the great re-enter-
ing angle of ‘the gate between the
two walls' (Jer. xxxix. 4), i.e.
between Ophel, the steep three-
cornered buttress of ‘ Moriah ’ south
of the Temple, and the adjacent
half-side of the square hill of ‘ Zion.'
This rendered absolutely unassail-
able the one opening in the line of
precipices which sronted the ravines
of Ben-Hinnom and the Kidron—
viz. the mouth of the valley separat-
ing the two city mountains; pro-
bably the Gihon of the O. T.‚ but
called by Josephus ‘the Cheese-
makers' ravine ’ (ὴ τῶν τυροποιῶν προ-
σαγορευομένη φάραγξ), from which
words modern topographers have

excogitated the conventional proper
name of ‘the Tyropoeon Valley.'

6 Extrema rupis] Comparing in-
tzcsin the next§‚ this must mean, ‘the
side first exposed to the (Roman)
assailants‚⁷ ᾖε. the north. There
was there no natural precipice, but
there may have been a scarped
trench, such as had before been
made to separate the fortress An-
tonia from the hill of Bezetha.

turres] There were ninety at
regular intervals in the outermost
wall, fourteen in the second,
and sixty in the oldest and in-
most. Besides, there was the
great ‘pebble tower' (ὁ ψήφινος
πύργος) at the north-west corner of
the outer wall, and the three already
described surrounding Herod’s pal-
ace‚ holding a similar situation in
the inner. The towers seem to
have been a characteristic feature of
the fortifications os Jerusalem, and
to have struck the Romans (Jos. B.
J. vii. 1. 1, Val. Fl. i. 14) as the
chief of the difficulties overcome by
Titus. Of the three great towers
near the palace‚ one (supposed to
be Phasael) is still standing, the
lower part being no doubt Herod's
original work.

centenos vicenosque] ‘ 120 in
every suclz case.' The assonance
between sexaginta and viginti is not
so marked as to make it likely that
Tacitus varies the form of the
numeral only to avoid it. Josephus
says no more than that the towers
rose 20 feet above the walls, but
the height of such parts of the
enceinte as have been excavated
makes it probable that Tacitus does
not exaggerate.
