though there is a certain zeugma in
making id solum do double duty,
as object to adnuere and subject to
credebatur. With the reading cre-
ditum, adnuere must be a historical
inf. The old Temple was dwarfed
by the house of Posides, a freedman
of Claudius, JuV. xiv. 9. 1. When
finally completed under Domitian,

They thought that, just as the
troops needed for the defence of the
Rhine had been drawn off to fight
for Vitellius, so those needed for
the defence of the Danube had gone
off to fight against him. But the
second battle of Bedriacum, unlike
the first, happened in time to avert
the danger, iii. 46. 3, 4.

Transalpinis] Perhaps it is Taci-
tus rather than the Druids, to whom
the nations of Europe seem divided
by nature into the civilised region of
the Mediterranean and the barbarians
beyond the mountains.

Druidae] They had been pro-
scribed by Tiberius, perhaps aster
the revolt of Sacrovir—whose Latin
or latinised name is conjectured to
indicate that he belonged to the
sacred caste. But they continued
to exist and to be known, though
the public exercise os their religion
might be forbidden : Ausonius speaks
of several of his contemporaries as
of druidical descent. In Ireland,
Sir H. S. Maine conjectures that the
druidical order passed into the Bre—
hons, whom we find holding a
similar authority in Christian times.
