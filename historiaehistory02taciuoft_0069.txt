tum animo exitium Valentis ut finem belli accepit.
erat Valens Anagniae, equestri famil-ia.
neque absurdus ingenio, famam urbanitatis per lasciviam
petere.
mox sponte mimos actitavit, sci‘te magis quam probe.

legionis et fovit Verginium et infamavit. Fonteium Capito- 4
nem corruptum, seu ‘quia corrumpere nequiverat, interfecit.
Galbae proditor, Vitellio fidus et aliorum perfidia inlustratus.
63 Abrupta undique spe, Vitellianus miles, transiturus in partes,
id quoque non sine deco‘re, sed sub signis vexillisque in
subjectos Narniae campos descendere.
ut ad praelium intentus ornatusque, densis circa viam ordini-
bus adstiterat.

adopted here and at iv. 34. 7 from
Hor. Od. i. 27. 6, and by the latter
from the common Grecism ἀμήχαν-
ον ὅσυν. Animo in constr. goes
with accepit: but it almost gives the
sense ‘ raised their spirits immensely,
by the view . . .': some would
read aucta or auctus.

3 ingenio] Generally of intellec-
tual faculties, but this and the simi-
lar passage, Sal. Cat. 24. 5, verum in-
genium cjus haud absurdum, are per-
haps the only places where it is dis-
tinctly opposed to moral excellence.

petere] Tae. did not determine
whether this is a hist. inf.‚ or de-
pending more or less loosely on the
two adjectives, ‘adissolute character,
and an intellect not contemptible‚
led him to seek . . .'

Juvenum] From Ann. xiv. 15. 1,
some conjecture Jtcvcnalt'wn. Or.
shows from a passage in Callistra-
tus and several inscrr. that Juvems
was a half technical term for com-

panies of amateur actors. Not im-
probably the two words were used
as correlative.

4 infamavit seems to point to
the 321ng imperfectly known events
as ι. . .

Fonteium, etc.] i. 7. 1, 2.

CH. LXIII. 1 id quoque] ‘ Were
resolved to do even that’ or ‘did
even that‚' according as We suppose
the acc. (see on 61. 1) to depend
exclusively on descendere or, in a less
direct way, on transiturus in parles.

sub signis vexillisque] In con-
trast with those who surrendered at
Cremona, 31. 5.

descendere] Perhaps likelier to
be a hist. inf. than a pl. agreeing
with the collective miles.

viam] Flaminiam, 79. 1.

2 legiones] See on 60. 2.

neque . . . validae] Enough to
keep them down in case of a dis-
turbance, but not enough to offend
them by their presence.
