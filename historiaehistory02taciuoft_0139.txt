7 An Neronem, etc.] A prophecy
of Domitian, between whom and
Nero there was a recognised par-
allel. See Agr. 45. 2,Juv. iv. 30,
Tertull. Apol. 5.

8 intestabilior et saevior] Gaius
was worse than Tiberius, and Nero
—Claudius cannot be meant—than
Gaius. Nero was born in the first
year of Gaius.

aetas . . moderatio] His
character is formed, and we know
it to be good.

exempla] Or. , after Burnouf, takes
this word as explained by the next
sentence, ‘ exempla quae edit senatus
immortalis‚’ opposed to the mores of

an individual. lt seems more nat-

ural to take both words as applying
to the individual emperor: his char-
acter only lasts his lifetime, but the
individual things he has done are
remembered, and may be used as
precedents. What Nero had done,
Domitian would see that he could
do; it made no difference to his
power, that Vespasian did not
choose to do it.

more majorum puniendos] τῖε.
flogged to death. The same sen-
tence was pronounced on Nero
himself,—the only prospect, it is
said, that availed to nerve him sor
suicide.

optimus . . . primus] Some·
times taken ironically, ‘people are
most sanguine then.' Rather, that
is an opportunity for reform that
should be made the most of.

CH. XLIII. Rufi] i. 8. 2, etc.

perinde] Sc. alque Marcellus.

eumne simul exemploque] At
