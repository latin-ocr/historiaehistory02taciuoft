perniciem] Too strong a term
to refer to any disgrace he may
have sustained under Galba, or to
his supersession (iv. 68. 2) in the
command of the Praetorians. &Vc
have no notice of his final fate.

3 defectione] Described at the
end of Book ii.

4 Forum Alieni] Was it, like
Vicetia (8. 2), connected with
Caecina’s family? If so, his father
or grandfather probably came to
Cisalpine Gaul as an official, or he
could scarcely have founded or given
name to a Forum. Although the
country was originally Tuscan, and
in some districts remained so, the
Caecinae seem to have belonged to
the better known Tuscany, where
there is a river of the same name.

5 id] That they were incuriosi.

appropriate.

Galbiana] We had the same form
in i. 51. 53 the z' is irregularly
inserted, perhaps because men were
used to troops being known by titles
so formed from gentile names (i. 70.
1, iii. 5. 5, 6. 4, etc.) 3 and the false
analogy would be the more readily
followed, becausethere was aSeptima
Claudiana. It has been noticed
that the same anomaly occurs in
the word Clerx-tz'anus,· probably the
earliest example is Varianus, Anu.
i. 10. 3, etc.

2 adductlus] So used in Anu.
