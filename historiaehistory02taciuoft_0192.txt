But the familiar Mun-sis the natural
Grecised or Latinised form of the
Hebrew stldslzk'h—which, if the
name were Hebrew, would mean
‘drawing out‚’ not ‘drawn out.'
The name seems to be really Egyp-
tian, but its meaning is uncertain;
not impossibly the derivation of Ex.
ii. 10 suggests the true one, by a
more than accidental paronomasia.
sibimet, duce caelesti] So M.;
the correction duci is easy, and it is
found in the MSS. of Orosius, who
(i. ιο) reproduces the whole sen-
tence. But duce is found in the ed.
pr. of Orosius, which must be inde-
pendent of M. ; and it is possible
to translate the text, ‘to trust in
themselves, regarding as a heavenly
leader the first person by whose
help they should cast off their
present distress) So interpreted,
we are to understand that the dux
cmlestis proved to be the ass, for
the context forbids us to think of
the angel of the scriptural account.
If we read duci, sibimet must mean
‘ himself, ’not ‘themselves,’ whether
or no we insert ut after or instead of
the syllable -.met Some read sibi-
metet duci, which will mean ‘-them
selves and' the ass. M. inserts
credentes after auxilio, no doubt by
a slip, though it will construe.
pepunseent] ‘ln oratione recta
pepuleritis, futurum exactum,' Or.
He promises that they shall escape

from their troubles, and bids them
take their deliverer when he a -
peared for a dux caelestis. T e
phrase, thus understood, appears

so much more appropriate to the ’

ass than to Moses as to afford a
presumption in favour of a reading
that will refer to the former.

3 mepta aquae] So obvious a
danger in the desert between
Egypt and Palestine that we need
not imagine a distorted version of
Ex xvii. or Num. xx. The rupes
n ’more opaca also may proceed
from a man who knew the desert· ,
the trees or shrubs caught the
eye, and suggested, but did not
prove, the presence of grass and
water, but it was proved by the
asses' visit.

for somehow. But, comparing the
story referred to in ii. 3, it is not
unlikely that the genuine Egyptian
myth of the god or demon called
Typhon by the Greeks, flying on
an ass for seven days from Hor-uz,
the son of Isis and Osiris, was de-
veloped by some Egyptian or
Graeco· -Egyptian rationalist into
this description of the relations,
between Egypt and the great
enemies of her religion.
