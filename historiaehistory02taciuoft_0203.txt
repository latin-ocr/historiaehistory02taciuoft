title Θεὸς, also borne by him: and
thus was led to attribute his acts to
Antiochus IL, commonly called
Θεὸς, from whom (during his war
with Ptolemy ΙΙ., Philadelphus)
Arsaces revolted, and established
the independence of Parthia. Taci-
tus cannot be acquitted of a mistake
of nearly a century 3 but it is more
probable that he misplaces the
Jewish war of independence than
the Parthian, as the latter must, in
the eyes of a Roman, have been by
far the more considerable event.
mores Graecorum dare] Epipha-
nes, the armed apostle of Hel-
lenism (a ‘caricatured Joseph 11.,'
Mommsen calls him, Hist. os Rome,
Book iv. c. 1, vol. iii. p. 61, Eng.
tr.)‚ was himself by no means a
favourable specimen of Hellenic
culture: see Polyb. xxvi. fr. 1, xxxi.
3-5. With many ualities ofa great
king (id. xxviii. 1 ), he made him—
self ridiculous by an affectation of
what he took for Roman manners
and polity‚ no more successful than
Nero's affectation of Greek: and
when once he had learned to set at
naught the conventional standard of
decorum, he soon utterly forfeited
his dignity by clownish horse-play,
while he tried to establish it by
barbaric profusiori. While his place
in sacred history and prophecy sug-
gests a comparison with Nero, and
the two had probably much in corn-
mon in their character, superficially
he rather reminds us of mere mad-
men like Gaius and Paulos Russia ε
he was nicknamed Ἐπιμανὴς by
Greeks as well as Jews.
teterrimam gentem] Tacitus,
who complains (Ann. ii. fin.) of
Roman indifference to the heroic

deeds of Arminius, would probably
have done justice to the far nobler
character and exploits of the Mac-
cabees, if he had read their history
with any attention. We may aequit
him of moral blindness, but only at
the expense of his historical im-
partiality‚ and even diligence‚ in
the treatment of a subject on which
he felt so strong prejudice.
Parthorum . . . desciverat] At
the time of the earlier campaigns of
Maccabaeus‚ Antiochus was gone
on an expedition into Elam and
Persia, plundering temples, and
very likely persecuting the one
national religion which, like the
Jewish, had enough distinctive
character to resist Hellenisation.
It is likely enough that the con-
temporary Parthian king, Arsaces
VL, Mithridates, a man of high
character, who a little later greatly
extended his empire at the expense
of the Syrian‚ was strengthened by
the reaction provoked by Epiphanes’
outrage on popular feeling: we
have, however, no evidence of actual
war between them. Antiochus'
death was ascribed by devout Jews
and pagans to the divine judgment
on his sacrilege, by the more ration-
alistic to his remorse for it, or
chagrin at its failure: see Ι Maec.
vi. 8 sqq„ Polyb. xxxi. 11. The
war against the Jews was not in-
terrupted by his absence or death :
but their ultimate success was due
to the dynastic quarrels that broke
out among the Seleucidae a few
years later. They received ⁴ moral
support‘ from Rome (1 Maec. viii.
21 sqq.‚ xv. 15 sq. .· there are
difficulties in the way of admitting
the genuineness, or at least textual
