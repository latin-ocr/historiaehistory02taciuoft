172 CORNELII TACITI

‘quoniam benignitate deum fractae hostiurn vires forent,
parum decore Domitianum, consecto prope bello, alienae

gloriae interventurum. Si status imperii aut salus Galliarum 5

in discrimine verteretur, debuisse Caesarem in acie stare:

Canninefates Batavosque minoribus ducibus delegandos. Ipse 6

Lugduni vim fortunamque principatus e proximo ostentaret,
nec parvis periculis inmixtus, et majoribus non defuturus!

Ita Lugdunum ventum.

dying young ceased to be a mis-
fortune, when it spared him the
sight os his country’s slavery), not
that ‘he accepted the consolation of
death‚' i.e. death as a consolation
sor the worse bitterness already past.

5 verteretur] ‘ Exquisitt‘us quam
‘versuumn’ Or. : i.e. it presents a
metaphor (the turn os a balance Ρ),
while the other has ceased to have
any figurative force.

caesarem] ‘A Caesar‚' one of
the imperial family, while the others
were waging an equally important
war elsewhere. Possibly the term
is also used as in a sense correlative
to Galliarum, ‘one bearing the name
os their original conqueror.'

CH. LXXXVI. pars obsequfl]
‘Part of their deference' not only
to him, but to Domitian, ‘consisted
in not detecting them.’ It would
have been as offensive to tell the
prince, ⁴ Your minister cannot trust
you,’ asto tell the minister, ‘You are

trying to discredit the prince.’ For
the sentiment, cf. Ann. xiv. 6. 1.
Pars seems most simply taken as
above: but we might translate, ‘it
was the part of courtliness not to
detect'—pars being, rarely in Au-
gustan but more frequently in later
Latin, used in the same sense as

parles.

in eo. ne] Ordinary grammatical
rules would require in eo ut non.

2 opes viresque adversus trat-
rem] After his accession, it was
considered courteous to assume that
he had what he was suspected os
having desired—that he was dis·
tinguishing himself in the north-west
at the same time as his brother was
in the south-east.

3 mamea . . . mann] See 2. 1,

3 131 glutudmem conditus] As we
might say, ‘burying himself deeply ι’
‘wrapped himself in a profound
reserve,' C. and B.
