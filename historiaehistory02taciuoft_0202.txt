is impossible here to discuss all the
questions, many of thern not yet
certainly solved‚ os the topography
os Jerusalem : see Jos. B. J. v. 4. 7
sor a detailed description. Tacitus
himself probably had not so clear a
notion of the arrangement as can
only be got (without a visit to the
site) by looking at or drawing a
plan, at least mentally. In this
sentence, which is to be illustrated
by ii. 5. 7, he does not mean that
the city, the palace, and the temple
formed three conccnlric lines of walls
(it would be little less than absurd
to suppose the palace surrounding
the temple), but three successive
lines, to be forced one after another
by assailants from the north, where
alone assault was practicable. The
Temple was, as a citadel usually is,
on the least assailable side. Herod's
palace, strengthened by the three
great towers called Mariamne,
l'hasael, and Hippicus, lay in the
xw. corner (nearest to the as-
sailants) os the oldest and inmas! city
wall3 and the outmost wall, begun
by the elder Agrippa, and now de-
fensible, though never finished, was
north of all. There was a wall, not
mentioned by Tacitus, intermediate
between the wall surrounding the
palace, and this outer one, which
included the suburbs os Bezetha and
the hill which we call Calvary: and
it ἰς possible that Tacitus' form of
statement is modified by a (not very
clear> knowledge os the fact that
there were these three lines of ram-
part, bcsidcs the Temple colonnades.

tantum Judaeo] To be taken to-
gether : if adfores tantum were, the
clause would be merely synonymous
with the next.

2 Dum . . . servientium] Taci-
tus knows nothing of the Davidic
monarchy nor of the Babylonish
Captivity: but within the limited
range he takes into account, his
view of the early history is not sar

wrong. He brings down the myth , 1

os the Exodus to the days of Boccho-
ris, so that the national history
cannot begin before then: now
(whatever doubts there may be as
to the exact numbers of years required
at this period sor the correlation of
Israelite, Egyptian, and Assyrian
chronology) Bocchoris was con-
ssssgzffiffssffisslzi ἒέαῗὲξῗὲἓζὲἓὲῥ
(or nearly so) of Hezekiah. He·
zekiah's reign, to be sure, though
severely tried by the Assyrian in-
vasion, was on the whole prosperous
and glorious: but from the con-
quest os Manasseh by Esarhaddon,
and the final depopulation of
Samaria by the same king (Is. vii.
8, Ezr. iv. 2), the political degrada-
tion os Israel may be reckoned to
begin: and in spite of the rare
energy and patriotism of N ehemiah‚
and the high moral position held by
such men as Simon the Just, it
cannot be said to have terminated
till the high-priesthood of Jonathan
the son os Mattathias.

rex Antiochus] The fourth of
that name, Epiphanes, was the per-
seeutor of the Jews. But Tacitus
apparently found him, in the autho-
rity he used, spoken of under the

mmm-xes· aa„ ι ,
