citus.

cavati . . . montes] The sub-
terranean aqueducts and other
excavations (perhaps granaries) are
now familiarly though doubtless
not exhaustively known from mo-
dern explorations. They play an
important part in the later history
of the siege, as having furnished a
temporary refuge to the survivors of
the capture, among them to the
leaders John and Simon.

praeviderant, eto] Tacitus (or
his authority Julianus : see on Fr.
2) may have heard these defensive
works ascribed to Hezekiah‚ whose
war with Assyria seems to have had
a religious character on both sides.
M. has providerant, but the prep.
being abbreviated we cannot be
certain that it is right.

3 empto jure muniendi] The
two old walls, dating from the days
of the monarchy (the second may
be that of Manasseh described in
2 Chron. xxxiii. 14), though several
times dismantled during the wars of
the Greek empires, had probably
never been again reduced to the
ruinous condition so graphically
described by Nehemiah 3 and even
in his day their line was still quite
traceable‚ and they could by a
vigorous effort be rendered defensi·
ble in a very short time. Tacitus
probably refers not to repairs of

these, but to the great wall of
Agrippa z nor is his statement quite
inconsistent with Josephus' (B. J.
V. 4. 2), ἄρχεται μὲν οὗ προείπομεν
τείχους, δείσας δὲ Κλαύδιον Καίσαρα,
μὴ τὸ μέγεθος τῆς κατασκευῆς ἐπὶ
νεωτερισμῷ πραγμάτων ὑπονοήσῃ καὶ
στάσεως παύεται θεμελίους μόνον
βαλόμενος. Agrippa may have paid
the officials of Syria to take no
notice, but have thought it wise to
stop before attracting that of the
emperor.

magna . . . aucti must refer,
not to the time of the fortification‚
but to that of the siege. Ceterae
nrbes are those of Galilee and else-
where, already taken by Vespasian.

pervicacissimus quisque] For
instance, John of Gischala had
abandoned his native city, after
the fall of Jotapata‚ Gadara, and
Gamala, and marched to Jerusalem
with all the fighting men‚-—aband-
oning the non-combatants in a way
that shocked the humanity of his
rival Josephus.

4 Simo . . . vocabant] There
is a mistake here, whether due to
Tacitus or to a copyist. It was
Simon who was the son of Gioras z
John of Gischala was the son of
Levi. The copyist has thrown
suspicion on himself by the clumsy
