Jerusalem, entered and burnt the
suburb of Bezetha, and might, Jo-
sephus thinks, have forced the city
wall, while the bulk of the popula-
tion was ready to welcome him.
But he wasted time in negotiation,
and at length, aster a few days' un-
successful assault, he, rightly or

proclaim their new commander, as
Verginius' troops had done sor Vitel-
lius. It was therefore necessary to
keep them employed, and that under
a loyal general.
