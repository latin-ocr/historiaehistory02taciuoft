In Bernays’ Essay on the Chronicle of Sulpicius Severus, after having
pointed out the passages where (in ii. 28. 2, 29. 1 sqq.) he embodies a
sentence or two os Tacitus (Anu. xv. 37, 38, 40. 3; 44. 3, 6) in his own
narrative, he suggests that we have in this passage, as in that preceding,
on the horrors os the siege, a similar case ; and showing ‘how few and os
what sort are those words of Severus, which Tacitus could not have
written,’ leaves the following as what he possibly may have, and as
probably representing substantially what he did :—

[inter omnes mortales nobilem], non debere deleri, quae
servata modestiae Romanae testimonium, diruta perennem
crudelitatis notam praeberet. At contra [Gaius et Gaius] et
Titus ipse evertendum templum imprimis censebant, quo
penitus Judaeorum et Christianorum [superstitio] tolleretur.
Quippe has [superstitiones], licet contrarias sibi, iisdem tamen
auctoribus profectas 5 Christianos ex Judaeis exstitisse3 radice
sublata stirpem facile perituram.

Fertur] Bernays suggests that Josephus' own, especially when, as
the ultimate authority sor the pas· here, the story is much more intrin-
sage is M. Antonius JulianuS, pro· sically probable than his (B. J. l. c.‚
curator of Judaea, and a member and ib. ἓξ 6, 7), and he had an

(JOS. B. J. vi. 4. 3) of the council obvious motive sor falsification;
of war held by Titus on this very writing under Titus' eye, when the

question, who, by a reasonable latter had begun to poseas deliciae ⁷

conjecture, is identified with the humani generis, it might please
Antonius Julianus quoted, as an both client and patron to exaggerate
authority sor the siege of Jerusalem both the humanity and the piety of
co-ordinate with Josephus, by the conqueror. Dio, lxvi. 6. 2,
Minucius Felix (Octav. 33). Such agrees with Tacitus, or at least
an authority is even higher than contradicts Josephus: οὐ μὴν καὶ
