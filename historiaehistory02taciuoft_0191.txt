of Aristotle as using the name in the

treatise on Sleep, written in the
form of a dialogue‚ in which Aris-

Lysimachus of Alexander is quoted
by Josephus, c. Ap. i. 34, as giving
this story, substantially as told by
Tacitus 3 it plainly was the fashion-
able one in the Graeco-Roman world.

utterly without historical value, or
that it only teaches that the Israe-
lites in Egypt lived under filthy and
unhealthy conditions. Manetho(ap.
Jos. c. A p. i. 26 : Chaeremon, ib. 32,
does not differ very greatly) says
that the Egyptian king Amenophis
(a name usually standing for Amen-
hotep, but here probably for
Mene-phtah) was commanded by an

oracle‚ if he wished to see the gods,
to purify Egypt os the unclean: and
that, after a struggle, the lepers and
others expelled by him went out,
led by the priest Osmsiph, other-
wise Moses. This seems to be a
version of the story contained in the
‘great Harris Papyrus‚⁷ where the
king Menephtah is bidden to ‘ pun-
ish the unclean' or ‘impious,' an
attempt to do which ends in their
emigration, after having for a time
occupied a district of Egypt in
opposition to the king. While it is
therefore not likely that Manetho‘s
story was, as Josephus thought, a
wilful invention, it is doubtful
whether he had historical authority
sor connecting it with the Israelite
Exodus. Probably the events as
told in the papyrus are at bot·
tom historica13 but Manefflo, know-
ing something about the Jews, and
finding nothing about them in his
authorities, identified them with the
‘unclean' exiles, as arbitrarily as
Josephus (c. Ap. i. 14) did with the
Hyksos or Shepherd Kings. By the
way, the history of the latter, as well
as the biblical story and the Dama-
scene version of it, would be covered
by Tacitus' language in 2. 4.

Egyptian name would be written
Μωυσῆς by Egyptian Greeks, who
perhaps knew of Josephus’ etymo-
logy (mo uslzc= ‘saved from water ’).
