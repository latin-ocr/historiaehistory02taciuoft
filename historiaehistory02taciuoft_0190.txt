CORNELII TACITI

the infant Zeus. But when the
legend os Saturn andJove is ration-
alised, they os course become a
tribe, expelled with the former.

e nomine] And possibly from
nothing else. It is however also
possible, that the Israelite immi-
grants into Palestine were in (Phoe-
nician ?) tradition confounded with
the Philistineimmigrants (see Amos
ix. 7), who carne from an ‘isle' or
sea-coast (Jer. xlvii. 4), which may
have been Crete. For this identi-
fication, however, the argument is
little better than Tacitus' : it rests
chiefly on the likeness os name
between Κρήτη and Crethim (A.
V. Cherethites) a race who seem to
be identical or intermixed with the
Philistines, 2 Sam. viii. 18, etc.,
Ezek. xxv. 16, Zeph. ii. 5.

mbarbarum] ‘Lengthened into
a barbaric sorm,’ i.e. one that does
not bear on its sursace an etymology
intelligible to a Latin or Greek ear,
as ldaci would. For the form of
sentence, cs. Ann. vi. 42. 1, neque
in barbarum corrupta (os the name
os Seleucia).

3 regnante Iside, etc.] Another
version of the story in c. 3, only
differing in throwing back the mi-
gration into prehistoric times.
Hierosolymus and Judaeus are sons
of Typhon, in a story reported by
Plutarch, de ls. et Os. c. 31.

Aetmopum . . . Cepheo] The
legend of Andromeda was localised

Clara alii Judaeorum initia,

at the rocks of Joppa, Jos. B. J.
iii. 9. 3: so Pliny, Pomponius
Mela, etc.

metus atque omum] Against
Cepheus Tacitus (or indeed the
legend he records) is not quite sure
whether to conceive the Jews as
driven srom or into Palestine.

4 Sunt qul, etc.] A version,
however indirectly obtained, of the
scriptural story. Tacitus could
hardly have been expected to read
the Septuagint Pentateuch: if he
had ever seen it, he would have felt
very uncertain of its historical
character. But Josephus' Antiqui-
ties, published (op. cit. fin.) in the
thirteenth year of Domitian, must
have been accessible to him ; at the
same time, it had not been in cir-
culation long enough to disarm the
prejudice felt against the work of a
Jew. Tacitus probably had hardly
read it, and is he had, would have
thought still that the presumption
was in favour of the Egyptian story.
It is supposed, that what he here
refers to was less the scriptural
story itselfthan that osJustin (xxxvi.
2), and N icolaus of Damascus (4),
who derive Abraham from Damas-
cus. But this is itself probably
founded on traditions starting from
the biblica! version 3 sor Abraham’s
visit to Damascus see Gen. xv. 2.

clara] Because Homer calls them

were the most formidable men ever
