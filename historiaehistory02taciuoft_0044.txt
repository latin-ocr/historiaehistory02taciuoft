CORNELII TACITI

Vernile dictum omnem invidiam in eum vertit, tamquam6

signum incendendae Cremonae dedisset, quae jam flagrabat.
Quadraginta armatorum milia inrupere, calonum lixarumque

amplior numerus, et in libidinem ac saevitiam corruptior.
Non dignitas, non aetas protegebat, quo minus stupra caedi-

bus, caedes stupris miscerentur.

Grandaevos senes, exacta 2

aetate seminas, viles ad praedam, in ludibrium trahebant.
Ubi adulta virgo aut quis forma conspicuus incidisset, vi

manibusque rapientium divolsus ipsos postremo direptores

in mutuam perniciem agebat.

Dum pecuniam, vel gravia3

auro templorum dona, sibi quisque trahunt, maj0re aliorum vi

truncabantur.

Quidam, obvia aspernati, verberibus tormentis·
que dominorum abdita scrutari, defossa eruere.

Faces in 4

manibus, quas, ubi praedam egesserant, in vacuas domos et
inania templa per lasciviam jaculabantur; utque exercitu
vario linguis, moribus, cui cives, socii, externi interessent,

diversae cupidines, et aliud cuique sas, nec quidquam inlicitum.

to be, that Antonius said, ‘Why
isn't the water hotter? it will be
hot enough soon‚’ not meaning to
order the fire, but jesting with the
fact that it was to be expected.
Such a jest Tac. calls vernile—coarse
and heartles8‚ but not criminal.

Cn. XXXIII. 1 quadraginta
armatorum milla] There were five
legions (roughly speaking 30‚000
men) besides the Praetorians and
auxiliaries. Their loss in the battle
is stated by Josephus at 4500, that
of the Vitellians (who had eight
legions) at 30, 200,—figures which are
not incredible, and may be derived
from official returns, though heis cer-
tainly wrong in implying that the
Vitellian loss destroyed their whole
army. Dio makes thern lose 50‚000.
8 amplior . . . corruptior] cs. ii.

7. 2.

2 direptores] παρὰ, προσδοκίαν
sor raptores.

3 truncabantur] ‘Were maimed,'

not αὐτη, ‘beheaded.' One man
seized a precious object, another
cried halves, and on his refusal to
drop it chopped his hands off.

4 vacuas . . . mama] The
parallelism of the two nearly synony-
mous words is Virgilian, Aen. vi.
269, Perque domos Ditis vacuas et
inania regna. Some take the second
word there to mean ‘unsubstantial,'
and so here we might paraphrase,
‘the houses whose inhabitants were
slain or hidden, and the temples
whose gods were powerless,' and
the same may be the sense in v. 9. 1,
but in Plin. Pan. 31 the two appear
to be mere synonyms, navigia inania
et vacua, opp. to lena et onusta.

exercstu varlo Probably an abl.‚
rather local than absolute.

allud nmque tas] Everything,
however sacred, was sure to meet
with some one whose national reli·
gion did not respect its sanctity.
