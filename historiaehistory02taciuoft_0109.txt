5 senes . . . inania leg-ionum
nomina] The most efficient troops
having marched with Valens into
Italy, i. 61. 2.

6 cujus . . . reddi] It is assumed
that Vespasian will overthrow Vitel-
lius ; then, says Civilis, if we are un-
successfulagainst the Vitellian troops
we shall still claim to have made a
useful diversion in Vespasian’s favour,
while, if we defeat the Roman troops
completely, we shall be as indepen-
dent of Vespasian as of Vitellius.

CH. XV. barbaro ritu . . .
adigit] In Liv. ii. 1 we have jure-
jurando adigit instead of the com-
mon construction jusjurandum ad„
but perhaps Tac. would not have
written as he has, except by a re-
miniscence of the common phrase
sacramento adigere, where note that
sacramento is proved by these analo-
gies to be abl. not dat.

Canninefates] We hear of thern
as distinguished among the Roman
auxiliaries in these parts, in Ann.
iv. 73. 2, xi. 18. 1.

origine, ung-ua, virtute, par]
As brave and as thorough Germans.

3 Gaianarum expeditionum ludi-
brium] The pl. because he projected
two, against Germany and Britain,
Germ. 37. 5, Agr. 13. 4. The sense
here seems to be, that when Gaius
marched his army into the island,
he defled him, and, as the expedi-
tion carne to nothing, he did so
with impunity. Ludibrium does
not necessarily imply Tacitus’ belief
in the gTotesque farce of collecting
‘the trophies of the Ocean;' it is a
question whether such an act is less
likely to have been done by a con-
fessedly crazy despot‚ or to have
been imagined by a credulous and
malevolent public. Merivale's sug-
gestion is at least ingenious. that the
collection of shells represents the
receiving a tribute of British pearls.

nomine] M. wrote at first homine,
the h is struck out, and omine makes
nearly as good sense as the text.
