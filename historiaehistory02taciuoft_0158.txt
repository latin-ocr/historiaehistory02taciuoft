arms but the swor‹l; and that though

the syllable per: some read prcffi,
which is commoner in this sense.

querente sane, etc.] The whole
story reminds the English reader of
the massacre at F ort William Henry
in 1757. There. Montcalm was
blamed, justly or no, for not re-

straining his Indian allies: but he
had disciplined forces at his dis-
posal, which Civilis had not.

plunderers were in the camp; the
fugitives returning there might throw
themselves into huts, and prolong
their defence a little, but could not
occupy the works so as to stand a
third siege.

CH. LXI. barbaro voto]
Scratch a Batavian, and you soon
found a Chattan‚ 12. 2, Germ. 29. 1.
In Germ. 31. 1 we are told that this
custom of letting the hair grow till
they had slain an enemy, adopted
by individuals throughout Germany,
was universal among the Chatti.
Caesar in Gaul once did the same, by
way of a vow to avenge the defeat
of Titurius and Cotta by Ambiorix.
The same practice, or similar ones,
have been found in half civilised
races in both earlier and later times
—e.g. the Scotch loyalists who, in
the seventeenth and eighteenth cen·
turies, ‘ wore a beard for the king.'

rutssatum] Dying the hair red
