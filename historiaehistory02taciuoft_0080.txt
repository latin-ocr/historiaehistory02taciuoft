68 CORNELII TACITI

publicae populi Romani accidit, nullo externo hoste, propitiis,
si per mores nostros liceret, deis, sedem Jovis Optimi Maximi
auspicato a majoribus, pignus imperii, conditam, quam non
Porsenna dedita urbe, neque Galli capta, temerare potuissent,
Arserat et ante Capitolium civili 2
bello, sed fraude privata: nunc palam obsessum, palam incen-
sum, quibus armorum causis, quo tantae cladis pretio stetit?
Pro patria bellavimus? Voverat Tarquinius Priscus rex bello 3
Sabino, jeceratque fundamenta spe magis suturae magnitudinis
quarn quo modicae adhuc populi Romani res sufficerent.
Mox Servius Tullius sociorum studio, dein Tarquinius Super· 4

surore principum exscindi.

CH. LXXII. 1 reipublicae p. R.]
A formula sollemnis, with the re-
dundant language characteristic os
one. In the decree in Liv. xxii.
10. 2, we have it still more redun-
dant, respublica populi
Quiritium.

nuno externo hoste] The Jews
and Germans who were in arms
against Rome had nothing to do
with this calamity.

promtus . . . dete] The con-
flagration was not ‘ the act os God ‘
in the legal sense—tle. from light-
ning or such natural cause.

pignus tmperfl] Referring to the
legend of the omen at its founda-
tion, Liv. i. 55, quae visa species
haud per ambages arcem eam imperii
caputque rerum fore portendebat.

Porsenna] So, according to M.,
Tac. wrote it, and the penult seems
to have been originally long, as
virgil makes it (Aen. viii. 646) ;
Horace (Epod. 16. 4), Martial, and
Silius Italicus have it short: see
Mommsen’s Hist. os Rome, Book i.
c. 9 (vol. i. p. 126, English transl.)

demta urbe] According to the
elder Pliny (xxxiv. 14. 39), the
treaty of submission was extant,
and seems to have been, as Niebuhr
says, such as, is it had been im-
posed by, not upon, the Romans,

Romani

    

would have figured in Livy thus:
agri pars tertia adempta: serrum
interdictum. Yet the survival of
so ancient a document, unknown to s
all earlier chroniclers, is strange:
the story is no doubt more intrinsi-
cally credible than the romance
popular in Rome, but it is difficult
to imagine why the Romans should
have elevated an oppressive con·
queror into a hero os romanoe, and
perhaps not difficult to imagine that
the patriotic vanity os a clusine
annalist may have imposed on the
uncritical industry and candour of
the emperor Claudius.

2 et. ante] ac. 83, during Sulla’s
return to Rome from the Mithrida-
tic war.

fraude privata] In fact the cause
was never ascertained. It may have

been done by some Italian enemy of
Rome.

quo tantm clama prauo stetit ¹1]
Note the rhythm, rather Juvenalian
than Virgilian. The subject to stetit
is ‘the event, the conflagratione
‘ what peace worth such a disaster .
did it bring?’

Pro patria bellavimus] For the ·
sentiment cf. i. 5ο. 4, 5. ’

that the work must have been cong
