51 Celeberrimos auctores habeo, tantam victoribus adversus fas

nefasque inreverentiam fuisse, ut gregarius eques, occisum a
se proxima acie fratrem professus, praemium a ducibus petierit.
Nec illis aut honorare eam caedem jus hominum aut ulcisci 2
ratio belli permittebat. Distulerant tamquam majora meritum
quam quae statim exsolverentur 3 nec quidquam ultra traditur.

Ceterum et prioribus civium bellis par scelus inciderat.

Nam 3

praelio quo apud Janiculum adversus Cinnam pugnatum est,
Pompeianus miles fratrem suum, dein, cognito facinore, se

ipsum interfecit, ut Sisenna memorat.

Tanto acrior apud 4

majores, sicut virtutibus gloria, ita flagitiis paenitentia fuit.
Sed haec aliaque ex vetere memoria petita, quoties res locus-
que exempla recti aut solatia mali poscet, haud absurde

52 memorabimus. Antonio ducibusque partium praemitti equites

omnemque Umbriam explorari placuit, si qua Apennini juga
clementius adirentur3 acciri aquilas signaque et quidquid
Veronae militum foret, Padumque et mare commeatibus

compleri.

CH. LI. 1 tantam . . . mre-
verentmm] It is curious that Tac.
treats this as proving more than in-
dividual brutality, whereas the simi-
lar story of c. 25 does something to
prove the reverse. Certainly the
civil wars of the late Republic were
as bad ‘good old times' as were
ever imagined.

3 praelio . . . adv. cinnam]
B.C. 87. We have the same story
mentioned as told by Livy, Epit.
lxxix., and Valerius Maximus, v. 5.
4. The latter (and Orosius) make
the slain man a soldier of Sertorius 3
the stories may be reconciled by sup·
posing Sertorius to have held a com-
mand under Cinna, and his troops
to have been those actually engaged
against Cn. Pompeiusffitrabo). The
authorities for the second story may
or may not have confounded this
fighting before Rome with the more
famous campaign of the younger

Erant inter duces qui necterent moras: quippe

Pompey against Sertorius; probably,
though the elder Pompey was held
to fight ‘for his own hand ’ rather
than forthe Senate, Tac. would not,
except in the light of later history,
have used the form Pompeianus, nor
Valerius sertorianus, which imply
rather attachment to a party leader
than allegiance to a divisional
commander.

4 Tanto acrior, etc.] Certainly
the son, in c. 25, did not kill him—
self, but Tacitus' contemporaries
were ready to do so on much less
occasion, so that nothing can be
proved by his omission.

haec aliaque] As in c. 72,
especially ξ 2, where again these
civil wars are compared with the
former as a climax os horror.

CH. LII. 1 clementius] So Ann.
xiii. 38. 5, Germ. 1. 3; as we say,
‘ a gentle slope.'

aquilas signaque] 50. 1, 60. 1.
