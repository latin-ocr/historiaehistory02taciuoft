Praetorianam

militiam repetebant a Vitellio dimissi, pro Vespasiano con-
gregati : et lectus in eandem spem, e legionibus miles promissa
stipendia flagitabat: ne Vitelliani quidem sine multa caede
pelli poterant3 sed inmensa pecunia tanta vis hominum re-
tinenda erat. Ingressus castra Mucianus, quo rectius stipendia

defined above—that he was really
hurt, and confined to his bed, and
that when he lest his house, he was
treated as being on the way to his

ave.
ἓτῦγτειιειιεϋῠιιε] Α dativus com-
modi, ‘ on the petition os.’

et exsilio] A zeugma in the
mildestsense ι either damnalur lqgre
rep. , or damnatur exsilio would have
been a regular constr.‚ but it is
rather harsh to have the two joined
as co-ordinate. The sense is, that
he would not have been banished,
but only had to resund‚ unless he
had added cruelty to rapacity.

Cu. XLVI. a V. amasi] ii.

71eetus . . . legionibus] ⁴ In-
duced to serve in hopes of being
drasted from the legions into that
force.’ There is no need to alter
the reading to inlectus.

tumenea pecunia tanta vis, etc]
A leas had at this point got trans-
posed in the archetype os M.; the
sact is noted in the margin, but
there 'ts some difficulty in deter-
mining the exact beginning and end
os the transposed passage. The
sequence in M. is—sed inmensa
Ιῥαιιηία *serunt ne criminantium

nuntiis( 52. 1—53. 5) magmficendae ’

defuisse crede* tanta vis hominum
(46. 1 sim—52. 1 init.) apud patrem
orasse* dicebatur. Madvig pointed
out that if the transposed pages
began and ended at the points
marked by asterisks, there is no need
to suppose a lacuna or considerable
corruption, only the copyist, having
lost the serunt in 52. 1, on which
Titum . . . orasse depended‚ con·
structed dicebatur out os the last two
syllables of credebatur, which he
found adjoining. Early editors read
here inmensa pecunia ferebatur or
dicebatur qua tanta vis, etc.‚ dice-
batur in 52. 1, and (sometimes)
creditum in 53. 5.

2 stipendla singulorum] The
amount ofpaydue to each individual‚
in proportion‚ not only to the length
of his service absolutely, but to the
length os time he had been in the
Praetorians.

spectaret] Any one but Tacitus
would have said nosceret, but per-
haps the word contributes a pic-
turesque touch to the story ; he not
only inquired into the service they

had passed through, but, saw the
proofs os it.

memoravimus] 2. 4-6.
