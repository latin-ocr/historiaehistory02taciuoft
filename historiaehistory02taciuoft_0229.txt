CORNELII TACITI

HISTORIARUM FRAGMENTA.

1. INTEREA Judaei obsidione clausi, quia nulla neque pacis
neque deditionis copia dabatur, ad extremum same interibant,
passimque viae oppleri cadaveribus coepere. Quin omnia
nefanda esca super ausi, ne humanis quidem corporibus
pepercerunt, nisi quae ejusmodi alimentis tabes praeripuerat.

SULP. SEVER. Iiz'st. Sacr. ii. 30.

That this was likely to be from Tacitus was first pointed out by
De Prato, the editor of Severus. It is acknowledged by Bernays in his
Essay (published at Berlin in 1863), though incidentally, in comparison
with his elaborate discussion and reconstruction os the next passage.

nulla . . . dabatur] This con· ρον, Josephus in the last passage

tradicts Josephus‚ who makes Titus
repeatedly (B. J. v. 9. 2 sqq., 11.
2, 13. 3, vi. 2. 1 sqq., 6. 2) offer
terms to the Jews, and who speaks
of the deed of the widow Mary (ib.
vi. 3. 4) as an exceptional horror,
felt as such by the zealot soldier-s
or ‘ robbers' themselves

fame . . . coepere] Cf. Jos. B. J.
v. 12. 3, 13. 7; vi. 1.1, 3. 3.

omnia nefanda] τὰ μηδὲ τοῖς
ῥυπαρωτάτοις τῶν ἀλόγων ζῴων
πρόσφορα συλλέγοντες ἐσθίειν ὑπέφε-

referred to. He does not, as one
might expect, refer to the unlawful-
ness of such food; but we cannot
be sure that nefanda is not Tacitus’
own word, nor even that he drew
from a Jewish source, if we com-
pare his language in iv. 60. 1.

esca super] So the Vatican ms.
of Severus5 but the common text,
through not understanding that the
preposition is put after its case,
reads insuper.

2. Fertur Titus adhibito consilio prius deliberasse an tem-
plum tanti operis everteret. Etenim nonnullis videbatur,

aedem sacratam, ultra omnia mortalia illustrem, non debere
deleri, quae servata modestiae Romanae testimonium, diruta
