4 comites] His suite.

proximus lictor] The Praetor,

patriae] See on ii. 12. 4.

CH. LXXXI. Musonius Rufus]
Tacitus was ashamed to be thought
a Stoic (see Agr. 4. 4), as elever
men in France, and perhaps else-
where, are ashamed to be thought
orthodox‚ and so he has no objec-
tion to laugh at a Stoic who lays
himself open to ridicule. But
Musonius was by no means a con-
temptible man ; he was the master
of EpictetuS‚ and is coupled with
Socrates by Justin Martyr, in his
first Apology, as an example of per-
secuted virtue. He was a friend of
Rubellius Plautus (Ann. xiv. 59. 2),
and was banished by Nero (ib. xv.
71. 9), and, it is said, made to work
as a convict on his Isthmian Canal.

Doubtless he returned on the fall
of Nero. He was exempted by
name from Vespasian's banishment
of the philosophers, which seems
to show that, like his great pupil,
he abandoned political agitation for
more spiritual objeets. But the
words of St. Justin (l. c.) may be
understood to imply that he was
put to death, perhaps by Domitian
—Suidas wrongly says by Nero.
equestris ordinis] Yet we find
him in the Senate a few days later,
iv. 10. Ι. He was a Tuscan, Αηη.
xiv. l. c., and no doubt of an
equestriansamily.

2 plerisque . . . pluribus] So
i. 39. 1. Plerique is similarly op-
posed to plurimi in iV. 84. 7, v. 2.

The phrase does not seem to occur
elsewhere, except Virg. Aen. x.
