2 arcus] Objected to, because
bows were not much used by the
Germans, and the Romans, we see,
used heavier missiles. Orelli's
argument, that they could not use
bows in the dark, scarcely agrees
with the next sentence, which shows
that they did use missiles, with or
without effect. But if the word is
to be corrected, his conjecture acrius
is no doubt the best proposed ι he
compares Ann. ii. 74. 1, where,
however, the sense is of a mental
not a physical effort.

3 non forte] ‘Not at random,'
as the Germans did: not impro-
bably it is also meant to contra-st
their sonnidable missiles with the
lighter ones of the enemy, especially
if arcus be right aster all.

4 propellere umbone] See 23. 4.

we hear of a similar one on a larger
scale—one of the scarcely credible
engines ascribed to Archimedes at
the siege of Syracuse.

verso pondere] The short heavy
arm of the free cross-beam approx-
imately balanced the longer but
slighter one (hence nutans, ‘oscillat-
ing‚’) to which the grappling-iron
was attached: when the former was
pulled (possibly a weight attached
to it shifted : but pondus is naturally
‘ the weight‚' as a statical or dyna-
mical force, not ‘a weight' in the
concrete) it over-balanced it, so that
the long arm rose to a nearly per-
pendicular position, and the man
caught by it (how was the grappling-
iron made to take hold os him when
lowered ?) was hoisted in a curve
over the rampart, and dropped in-
side. There is no need to suppose
that the whole machine turned
round horizontally like the roos of a
windmill.
