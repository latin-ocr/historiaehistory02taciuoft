CORNELII TACITI

Joannes, † quern et Bargioram vocabant, templum Eleazarus
firmaverat. Multitudine et armis Joannes ac Simo, Eleazarus

loco pollebat.

Sed praelia, dolus, incendia inter ipsos, et5
magna vis frumenti ambusta.

Mox Joannes, missis per

speciem sacrificandi qui Eleazarum manumque ejus obtrun-

carent, templo potitur.

Ita in duas sactiones civitas discessit,

donec, propinquantibus Romanis bellurn externum concordiam

habitually called by Josephus a
τύραννος; we might almost as ac-
curately define his position by
calling him aJacobin dictator: he
had at least as much excuse as
the French terrorists sor treating
the moderate party and the sacer·
dotal aristocracy as traitors to the
nation. 'she high priest Hanan
(Ananus in Josephus, son and
namesake to the Annas os the
Gospels, himself the man who
ordered the execution of St. James
the Just), and even the able Jose-
phus, wanted to conduct the war on
the assumption that peace was
possible, · john knew better. At
the same time, we can find abso-
lutelyno good point in his character:
allowing as much as we will sor
the personal enmity os Joseplius‚
we cannot doubt that he was un-
principled as well as unscrupulous.
Eleazar (the son os Simon, ap-
parently a priest, but not to be con-
founded with Eleazar, son ofAnanias
the‘ whited uallss who heldasome-
what similar position at an earlier
period of the war) had withdrawn
into the temple with a portion os
the Zealots, professing dis sgust at
John⁷ 5 cruelties. Simon, who had
distinguished himself in the defeat
os Ces tius, and was now at the head
of a large partisan soree in the
south, was invited in by the relies
os the moderate partyasy a deliverer
from John, but aster his arrival was
scarcely less tyrannical. He was
beheaded, aster ancient precedent,

at the triumph of Vespasian and
Titus: John’s life was spared,
which seems discreditable both to
him and the emperor.

Multitudtne et arms] ‘The
number os armed men.’ Eleazar's
soree was probably as well armed
as John’s, and better provisioned.
Simon had 15‚000, including 5000
Idumaeans who revolted srom john ;
John had 6000, and Eleazar 2400,
Jos. B. J. v. 6 init. In l. c. we
have an exact statement of the part
of the city occupied by each.

4, 5 Eleazarus . . . rum] Per·
haps we ought to follow M. in
reading Alazarus or Lazarus.

5 magna . . . ambusta] Josephus
asserts (B. J. v. 1. 4fin.) that it
would have lasted them sor years,
and that the city was only taken sor
want os it—the first statement in-
credible, and the other salse.

per speciem sacrificandi] At the
Passover, B. J. v. 3. 1. Josephus
characteristically but not improbably
(Num. xxxi. 19) asserts that the
elmissaries were most of them un-
c ean.

qm . . . obtruncarent] Tacitus
implies, though his words do not
expressly state, that the intention
was executed: in sact, Josephus
says (l. c.) that fewer of the Zealots
were massacred than of the peace·
able worshippers. certainly Eleazar
and his surviving men passed into
the service os John.

Ita . . . pareret seems almost a
verbal reminiscence of Jos. v. 3. ι
