’ Voculam deseritis.

tam inprovisi adsiluere, ut in cubiculo ac lectulo Cerialis
(neque enim noctem in castris egerat‚) pugnari simul vincique
suos audierit, increpans pavorem nuntiantium, donec universa
clades in oculis fuit. Perrupta legionum castra, fusi equites: 2
medius Mosellae pons, qui ulteriora coloniae annectit, ab
hostibus insessus. Cerialis, turbidis rebus intrepidus et fugi-

felici temeritate et fortissimi cujusque adcursu, reciperatum
pontem electa manu firmavit. Mox in castra reversus‚3

3 apud Novesium Bonnamque]
We heard of the surrender of
Vocula's army at the former place

mitted, but there was still a con-
}ingent in arms in the confederate
orce.

in cubiculo ae lectulo] Simi-
larly coupled in 24. 3. The cubi-
culum might be used as a study
(eng. Dial. 3. 1); being there did
not prove a man to be helpless or
heedless‚ as being in bed did.

neque enim] Cf. v. 22. 4. He
was habitually luxurious, if not
vicious.

2 legionum castra] Evidently

ι on the left bank of the river.

medius M. pons] Was there a
turreted gateway over the bridge‚
up to which the Germans had
penetrated‚ aster forcing the camp
and the tete du pont ? The Roman
bridge, which was in the middle of
the town, has now disappeared.

turbidis . . . intrepidus de-
scribes his habitual character, as
well as his behaviour now.

in 57. 4 sqq. Bonna, the next town
above the Agrippine colony, was
naturally one principal scene of the
surrender of 59. 4, though not men-
tioned.

non Flaccum . . . non Voculam]
Both had been half-hearted as long
as Civilis professed to be acting in
the interest of Vespasian. Other-
wise, Vocula had behaved better
than Herennius 3 ifthe latter's saults
were held to be purged by his death,
the former’s ought to have been.
But in pardoning the troops, Cerialis
had thought it wise to throw as
much blame as possible on the
generals who could not be hurt by
it, 72. 5 fin.

Tacitus was not led to ask himself
whether the tone of the speech was
