So CORNELII TACITI

dispares, inquietare victoriam, morari pacem, domos arasque
cruore foedare, suprema victis solatia amplectebantur. Multi
semianimes super turres et propugnacula moenium exspiravere.
Convolsis portis reliquus globus obtulit se victoribus; et
cecidere omnes contrariis volneribus, versi in hostem : ea cura
etiam morientibus decori exitus suit. Vitellius, capta urbe, 4
per aversam Palatii partem Aventinum in domum uxoris sellula
defertur, ut, si diem latebra vitavisset‚ Tarracinam ad cohortes
fratremque perfugeret, Dein mobilitate ingenii, et (quae 5
natura pavoris est‚) cum onmia metuenti praesentia maxime
displicerent, in Palatium regreditur vastum desertumque,
dilapsis etiam infimis servitiorum aut occursum ejus declinan-
tibus. Terret solitudo et tacentes loci3 tentat clausa, inhor- 6
rescit vacuis ; fessusque misero errore, et pudenda latebra

semet occultans, ab Julio Placido, tribuno cohortis, protra- ’

os military honour that supersedes
civic patriotism.
3 mqmetare . . . morari . . .

foedare] The sentence begins as
though these were meant for histori-

their way to join their comrades,
as yet scarcely beaten, in the de·
sence of the camp.

Aventtnum] 70. 2.

³1 mem latebra vitavisset] Is

cal infinitives ; actually they depend
on amplectebantur, or rather are
epexegetical of solatia, as no Latin
writer but Persius could have writ-
ten inquietare victoriam amplector.

semmmmes . . . exspiravere]
They sell wounded on the ramparts,
and were lest to die.

contras-us volneribus] Or. com-
pares contrario ictu in Liv. ii. 6,
and understands this passage as
meaning, like that, that each killed
his man before or as he t'ell. But
it is probably in both places only
a stronger expression sor adversis v.
(Anu. xvi. 9. 5, etc.) It is stupid
to say that this makes versi in hostem
redundant.

4 capta urbe] By the assault from
the Campus Martius and the second
defeat (82. 6) in the streets of the
troops driven from thence. The
remnants os these no doubt made

diem the object to vitavisset‚ ‘avoided
the day-light by hiding‚' or, an
acc. of time, ‘avoided (the enemy)
through the daytime'? Os course
it is wrong to assume, as some do,
that it stands sor illum diem, as
though he had a superstitious notion
that if he survived that day he was
safe.

5 mobffltate mgenfl] According
to Suetonius, hearing a rumour that
peace was made.

6 tacentes 1001] Aen. vi. 243.

pudenda latebra] A room in the
porter’s lodge, used, according to
Dio, as a dog-kennel. Tac.probably
means the same, but thinks it below
the dignity os history to mention the
detail ; or he may have thought it
uncertain, as Suetonius makes him
blockade the door with a sofa‚ which
implies that the place was fumished
sor the abode os bipeds.
