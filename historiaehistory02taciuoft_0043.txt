HISTORIARUM III. 32. 31

32 Plebs interim Cremonensium inter armatos conflictabatur;
nec procul caede aberant, cum precibus ducum mitigatus est
miles. Et vocatos ad contionem Antonius adloquitur, magni· 2
fiee victores, victos clementer, de Cremona in neutrum.
Exercitus, praeter insitam praedandi cupidinem, vetere odio
ad excidium Cremonensium incubuit. Juvisse partes Vitelli· 3
anas Othonis quoque bello credebantur 3 mox tertiadecimanos
ad exstruendum amphitheatrum relictos, ut sunt procacia
urbanae plebis ingenia, petulantibus jurgiis inluserant. Auxit 4
invidiam editum illic a Caecina gladiatorum spectaculum,
eademque rursus belli sedes, et praebiti in acie Vitellianis
cibi, caesae quaedam feminae studio partium ad praelium

progressae. Tempus quoque mercatus ditem alioqui coloniam

majorum opum specie complebat. Ceteri duces in obscuro: 5

Antonium fortuna famaque omniurn oculis exposuerat. Is

balineas abluendo cruori propere petit. Excepta vox est,
cum teporem incusaret, ‘statim futurum ut incalescerent.’

CH. XXXII. 1 caede] A more
general massacre than afterwards
ensued. Tac. seems to give the
impression that the troops were
ordered not to kill the inhabitants
nor (34. 3) to enslave them, but
that they had received tacit license
to plunder the town, and that their
burning it was winked at. The
sack of a city is much the same in
all ages ; the peculiar aggravation
in this case was, that the place had
not been stormed‚ but the fighting
men in it admitted to terms. Dio
asserts‚ indeed, that they took part
in the sack. It is only sair to the
generals to remember that Roman
discipline had been insufficient, even
in the best ageS, to prevent the sack
of Phocaea after a formal capitula-
tion, Liv. xxxvii. 32.

5, 6 Excepta. vox est . . . ver-
nile dictum] Several commentators‚
including Or., take the vox to be
that of the bath-man. Vernile dic-
tum cannot mean ‘the word of a
slave,' but might mean ‘the com-
monplace formula in such case&
as Or. understands it, and so the
text cannot be said to exclude the
view that the slave said ‘they will
be warin soon‚’ and ineant no more
than he said; but that he was
thought to mean to taunt Antonius
with having already given orders
to burn the town. But such a
taunt would surely have been too
rash to have been uttered, or even
imagined, and even isit was uttered
it might have proved the general
belief in Antonius’ guist, but could
not be said to have occasioned it.
The sense therefore seems clearly
