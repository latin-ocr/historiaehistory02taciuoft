Antonius

Et exciti

prospero clamore, qui modo per agros fuga palabantur,

accounts him a good soldier, and
does not mean here to charge him
with personal cowardice; but by a
metonymy common in all languages,
he is spoken of when his division
is meant.

turbae] Includes the notions os
a large body and a disorderly one.

Cn. XVII. 1 ubl . . . unde]
The disserence between the two is
obvious, but untranslateable by
means os the adverbs themselves;
⁸ wherever the pressure was hardest,
wherever any hope could be sbund,’
perhaps expresses it.

consino manu voce] We get the
two latter coupled again in 29. 4;
al>o Arm. ii. 17. 5, manu voce vol-
nere. Consilio, not ‘by his en-
couragement,' which would be too
near in sense to voce, but ‘by his
skill ;' manu, by his example in
fighting, not merely by gesticulation.

2 Quo pudore] ‘ 'souche-<l by the
reproaehf C. and 13„ rightly; see
on 2. 7.

restitere] A correction sor resis-

tere. The general rule, that the
historical infin. is used when a series
of verbs come in quick suceession,
admits of exceptions in Tac. (e.g.
i. 50. 2), as in other authors; but
the finite tense seems here to har-
monise better with the tone, and
at 29. 4 M. has the vox nihili resic-
terann a mistake exactly parallel-
ing that supposed here. Note the
pregnant brevity of Tacitus' way
of saying that a party of cavalry
dii-d stop, and how sew they were3
c . n. 41. 4.

incerto alveo] The uncertain
footing in its bed, both from the
varying depth os the water and the
character of the bottom.

3 Atque] One of the passages
where the word seems to have the
sense os ‘ immediately‚' as in Virg.
Ganga i. 203, Liv. xxvi. 39, atque
ille praeceps cum armis procidit.
M. has illic sor the next word,
whence an ill-regulated ingenuity
might conjecture alque illico.

4 abripere] From prisoners,
