CORNELII TACITI

HISTORIARUM

LIBER QUINTUS.

EJUSDEM armi principio Caesar Titus, perdomandae {Iudaeae
delectus a patre, et privatis utriusque rebus militia clarus,
majore turn vi famaque agebat, certantibus provinciarum et

exercituum studiis.

Atque ipse, ut super fortunam crederetur, 2

decorum se promptumque in armis ostendebat, comitate et
adloquiis officia provocans, ac plerumque in opere, in agmine

gregario militi mixtus, incorrupto ducis honore.

Tres eum 3

in Judaea legiones, quinta et decuma et quintadecuma, vetus

Vespasiani miles, excepere.

CH. 1. delectus] It was not a
matter of course that he should
succeed his fatherin the command :
there were several able officers there,
as Cerialis, Placidus, and the elder
Trajan. And the anarchy of the
last year had so demoralised public
feeling, that Titus after his victory,
as well as Domitian now (iv. 86.
2), were suspected of disaffection to
their father.

privatis . . . ciarus] See on ii.
77. 2. Titus had also distinguished
himself in the earlier part of the
Jewish war, before the death of
Nero. Privatis is a sels-evident
correction for filulis, zie. praelatis.

2 ut super fortunam crederetur]

To prove that he was not dependent

Addidit e Suria duodecumam,

on fortune for his eminence, as his
merits were even higher than his
present position as consul, general,
and Caesar. We must remember

that the family of Sabinus and ·

Vespasian had no distinction: its
rise would be treated as a ridicu-
lous caprice of fortune, unless their
merit was shown to account for it.

1n armls] In actual fighting:
opposed to ‘in the trenches or on
the march ² (in opere, in agmine).

officia] ‘A willing obedience,'
C. and B.; the men were glad to
do him a personal favour, and in
good humour with their military
duties also.

3 duodecumam] The one defeat-
ed under Gallus at the beginning
