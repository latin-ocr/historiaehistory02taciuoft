CORNELII TACITI

eo ipso tempore fore ut valesceret Oriens, profectique Judaea

rerum potirentur.

Quae ambages Vespasianum ac Titum3

praedixerat: sed volgus, more humanae cupidinis, sibi tantam
satorum magnitudinem interpretati, ne adversis quidem ad

vera mutabantur.

Multitudinem obsessorum, omnis aetatis,

virile ac muliebre secus, sexcenta milia fuisse accepimus.

from the restoration os Jerusalem to
its destruction. at least as clearly as
to indicate the date os the Cruci-
fixion: and although the received
Christian computation of 490 years
from B.C. 457 to Ap. 33 is more
chronolo ically accurate than any
that has {een proposed ending Α. D.
70, the latter view seems to have
been the older. XVhen the original
Lxx. version of Daniel was made,
the prophecy seems to have been
regarded as already sulffllcd, in
the profanation of the Temple by
Antiochus; but this is hard to
reconcile either with chronology or
with the language os the prophet.

3 Quae ambages] The sing. is
not used elsewhere, except in the
abl. ambage (found, ag. in Tacitus
himself, Ann. vi. 46. 6).

V. ac Τ. praedixerat] There is
no reason to dispute Josephus’
claim to the questionable credit of
having invented this interpretation :
Tacitus (and Suetonius, Wsp. 4)
got it from him, B. J. v. 5. 4. It
is quite possible that he may, as he
asserts (ib. iii. 8. 9), have prophesied
Vespasian's succession to the empire
on the strength of it, even before
the death of Nero. In Ant. x. 10.
4fin., he blinks, with more policy
than honesty‚ the fact that the
Messianic hopes of his nation,
which he dared not disavow, though
unwilling to express them, were
iRncompatible with the eternity of

oman ower.

nuntiiudtnem . . . accepimus]
Tacitus avoids making himself re·
sponsible sor the incredible estimate.

Josephus on the contrary (B. J. vi.
9. 3) estimates the prisoners taken
during the whole war at 97‚000
(which is possible), and the dead
during the whole siege at 1,100,000.
The ordinary population of Jeru-
salem at this period was probably
about 50,ooo: Renan suggests that
Rev. xi. 13 implies an estimate of
70,000, which is the hi
sistent with the area οξ the city.
On the other hand, in the revulsion
from the wild exaggerations of our
authorities, modern critics have
been disposed to understate the
numbers who are likely to have
visited the city for festivals (and
josephus l. c. observes, that those
who carne up to the Passover were
caught by the siege) or have been
driven into it by an invading army.
In the former case, the Gospels
suggest that many pilgrims ordin-
arily had to lodge in the surround-
ing villages, or even in the open
air; in the second, Jer. xxxv. 11

shows how the most nomadic of

Israelites fled within the walls, and
in Isa. xxxvi. 1 1 we are no doubt to
understand ‘the men that sit on the
wall ' as country folks camping in
the miserable and unhealthy manner
described in Thuc. ii. 17. Nor is
it likely that Josephus‚ a competent
soldier and administrator, and (de-
spite a tendency to the sensational)
an excellent military historian, ex·
aggerates the number of the regular
troops ; that of gross population he
does exaggerate constantly. We
may guess that Tacitus’ figure is
about four or five times the truth 5
