64 CORNELII TACITI

pauci sumpsere.

Circa lacum· Fundani descendentibus, qui·

Sabinum comitabantur, armatis occurrunt promptissimi Vitel-

lian orum.
prosperum Vitellianis fuit.

Modicum ibi praelium inproviso tumultu, sed
Sabinus re trepida, quod tutissi- 4

mum e praesentibus, arcem Capitolii insedit mixto milite et

quibusdam senatorum equitumque 3 quorum nomina tradere

haud promptum est, quoniam, victore Vespasiano, multi id

meritum erga partes simulavere.

Subierunt obsidium etiarn

feminae, inter quas maxime insignis Verulana Gratilla, neque
liberos neque propinquos sed bellum secuta. Vitellianu85
miles socordi custodia clausos circumdedit 3 eoque, concubia
nocte, suos liberos Sabinus et Domitianum fratris filium in

Capitolium accivit, misso per neglecta ad Flavianos duces
nuntio, qui circumsideri ipsos et, ni subveniretur, artas res

nuntiaret.

Noctem adeo quietam egit, ut digredi sine noxa 6'

potuerit z quippe miles Vitellii, adversus pericula ferox, labori-
bus et vigiliis parum intentus erat, et hibernus imber repente

70 fusus oculos auresque impediebant.

Luce prima Sabinus,

antequam in vicem hostilia coeptarent, Cornelium Martialem
e primipilaribus ad Vitellium misit curn mandatis et questu

laeum Fundani] At the soot of

the Quirinal. No doubt it was so
called from a pond or swamp that
had now disappeared, like the more
famous Lacus Curtius.

4 arcem capitoni] So Capitolinae
arcis in 71. 1. Livy, on. the contrary,
usually couples Arx et Capitolium„
and topographers hold that, strictly.
speaking, the two were distinct,
being names appropriate to the two
summits of the Tarpeian hill. Capi-
lolium is in itself as much an appel-
lative as Arx, but is rarely used os
other citadels than the Roman.

mixto multe et qmbusdam]
Exactly the same as is he had writ-
ten mixtis, but the partic. agrees
with the nearest subst.

obsidium] They expected rever-
ence for the place, or its traditional
strength, to prevent an assault.

5 suos uberes] He had two sons,
Sabinus and Clemens, both aster-
wards put to death by Domitian.

6 laboribus et vtsufls] Compare
what was said of their demoralisa-
tion, ii. 93. ι.

Cu. LXX. r in vicem hostffla
coeptarent] His own men had
marched in arms, but not intending
to fight (69. 3) when they were sur-
prised by the Vitellians ; he now
saw that he must prepare to fight
deliberately‚ and took care to place
himself in the right before doing so.

e prlmpflarlbus] Related to

primipilus as consularis to consul.
