HISTORIARUM III. 79. 75

ostentare potius urbi bellum quam inferre, quando validissimae
cohortes a Vitellio descivissent, et, abscisis omnibus praesidiis,
cessurus imperio videbatur. Sed cuncta festinatione, deinde 4
ignavia Sabini corrupta, qui, sumptis temere armis, muni-
tissimam Capitolii arcem, et ne magnis quidem exercitibus
expugnabilem, adversus tris cohortes tueri nequivisset. Haud
facile quis uni adsignaverit culpam, quae omnium fuit. Nam 5
et Mucianus ambiguis epistolis victores morabatur, et Antonius
praepostero obsequio, vel dum regerit invidiam, crimen meruit 3

finem ejus insignivere] ‘ Made

its end notable’ sor the burning of

before, when haste was only justi-

when promptitude was called for by
circumstances unknown to Muci-

dum regerit invidiam] ‘ In an
attempt to throw back on him the
discredit ' of any disaster that might
occur,—to be able to say, ‘ So long
as I managed my own way every-
thing went well ; as soon as
Mucianus interfered, Ι loyally
obeyed him : but you see the
result! The special invidia of the
buming of the Capitol cannot be

the Capitol and battle in the city,
which they might have prevented
so easily.
