ceeded to intrench itsels on the
Mount os Olives, the Jews made a
fierce attack upon them, which
nothing but Titus' vigour and per-
sonal courage prevented from suc-
ceeding: ib. 4 5. Tacitus apparently
blends the two combats in his
account. Josephus does not mention
cavalry as engaged in the second
and more serious one, and from the
nature os the ground they scarcely
could be. But the expedilae cohortes
may represent the troops kept under
arms while their comrades were in-
trenching.

2 crebra. . . . pellerentur] Jos.
B. J. v. 3. 3-5. The sorties <le-
scribed, ih. 6. 5, 7. 3, etc., belong
to a later period of the siege than
Titus here speaks of.

3 Neque emm. . . opperiri] They
came however to think seriously
of it afterwards, while Titus kept
to their original point os view, Jos.
B. J. v. 12. 1. Tacitus perhaps
is thinking os that passage, where
Josephus says, αὐτῷ δὲ τὸ μὲν ἀρνγεῖν
καθόλου μετὰ τοσαύτης δυνάμεως οὐκ
ἐδόκει πρέπειν.

ferocia] Though opposed to virtus
here, we had this word coupled
with ardor and used in a good sense
in ii. 76. 8. The general usage of

Nam duos colles inmensum

Ipsi Tito Roma et opes voluptatesque ante4

Sed urbem arduam situ opera molesque firmaverant, 5
quis vel plana satis munirentur.

the adj. ferox and its derivatives‘

shows, that even where the sense is
as much depreciatory as here, the
{Zie'is rather ⁶ pride' than ‘ fierce-
4 Ipsi nto, etc.] Compare ii.
2.
morari] ‘ To keep him waiting,'
a rather curious personification, as
Or. thinks, of the voluptates: it
would be easier to take Hierosolyma
as the subject.

5 vel plana . . . Nam] The city
was virtually unassailable on three

sides, and strongly sortified on the
fourth (the northern).

duos eones] Those called by
modern topographers (though most
recent ones dispute the nomencla-
ture) Zion and Moriah: the former
containing the ‘Upper City' of
{sargite ¹²}ffszg1fflffiffib22

the city as including, at the date of

the siege, two other hills (‘Calvary’
—he of course does not use the

name, which only modern tradition ,-

assumes to be that os a hill—and
Bezetha) lying to the north os these
two respectively: but these were
(or at least are) comparatively
slight elevations‚ not addmg much
to the strength of the defences.
