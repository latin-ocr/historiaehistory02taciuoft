Inde volgatum, nulla intus deum effigie vacuam
Muri Hierosolymorum diruti, delu-
Mox civili inter nos bello, postquam in 2

dicionem M. Antonii provinciae cesserant, rex Parthorum
Pacorus Judaea potitus, interfectusque a P. Ventidio, et
Parthi trans Euphraten redacti: Judaeos G. Sosius subegit.
Regnum ab Antonio Herodi datum victor Augustus auxit. 3
Post mortem Herodis, nihil exspectato Caesare, Simo quidam

regium nomen invaserat.

Is a Quintilio Varo, obtinente

Syriam, punitus ; et gentem coercitam liberi Herodis tripertito

rexere. Sub Tiberio quies.

Dein jussi a G. Caesare effigiem 4

ejus in templo locare, arma potius sumpsere 3 quem motum

being brought on by an earlier
fratricide.

nulla . . . arcana] ἔκειτο δ’ οὐδὲν
ὅλως ἐν αὐτῷ, Jos. B. J. v. 5. 5;
and unanimous Jewish tradition
represents the Ark, and by conse-
quence the Cherubim, as wanting
in the second Temple. Conse-
quently the story of Malelas must
be rejected, that the Cherubim were
captured by Titus and presented to
the city of Antioch. See on 4. 2.
For the collocation of vacuam and
inania, cf. Virg. Aen. vi. 269 : the
words differ as ‘empty’ and ‘m'th
nothing in it,' z'.e. no object account—
ing sor a temple being built in its
honour.

diruti] They were however soon
restored by Antipater, Jos. Ant.
xiv. 9. 1.

2 rex Parthorum] See on ii. 2.
1, 25. 3.

sosius] So he is spelt on coins,
and so M.: Josephus (Ant. xiv. 15.
9, etc., B. J. i. 17. 9, etc.) and
Plutarch (Aulon. 34) spell the
name with a double s.

3 Regnum . . . aux-lt] Accord-
ing to Josephus (B. J. i. 20) Herod
claimed credit for his fidelity to
Antony: at any rate Augustus

immediately gave him districts at
the south-west that had belonged
to Cleopatra, and afterwards added
the north-east districts of Hauran,
Bashan, and Trachonitis.

Simo quidam] A slave of Herod's,
Jos. Ant. xvii. 10. 6.

liberi H. tripertito] Archelaus
taking Idumaea, Judaea, and Sa-
maria, with the title of Ethnarch;
Antipas, Galilee and Peraea, and
Philip the north-eastern district, as
Tetrarchs.

4 Sub Τ. quies] He takes no
notice of the rising of Judas the
Gaulonite in Augustus’ time, ΑΛ).
6, which was really the first symp-
tom of the spirit of the final war,
nor of the less important ones pro-
voked and suppressed by Pilate.

jussi . . . locare] The philoso-
pher Philo went on the embassy
sent to Rome to deprecate the
sacrilege, and his account of their
adventures is extant. See also Ann.
xii. 54. 2, but compare Jos. Ant.
xviii. 8, B. J. ii. 10.

arma potius sumpsere] An over-
