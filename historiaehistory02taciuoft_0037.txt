4 tertiam] who had only lately
been withdrawn from Syria (ii. 74. 2)
where they had served under Corbulo.
For the custom, cf. Ezek. viii. 16,
Jos. B. J. ii. 8. 5. It seems to
have been wide-spread in the East ;
the Parthians are said to have done
the same before a battle.

CH. XXV. 1 vag-us . . . rumor]
‘A report, either vaguely arising
from this cause, or deliberately
suggested. . . .' Their comrades
saw thern turning round and kissing
their hands, and thought it was to

here only an instance of Tacitus'
habit of using simple verbs in the
sense of compounds.

denso agmine] F orming a column
to charge along the highway.

limitem viae] ‘The line of the
(Postumian) road‚' not the limes of
21. 2. Perhaps the word is used
because the road was perpendicular
to the line along which their front
had been extended.

victores] Kept to the end of the
sentence to heighten the contrast
with what is said of the opposite

less remote friends than the sun.

diduceretve] M. has the simple
verb duceret, which could hardly
mean ‘lengthened (and so thinned)
the line.' Reading as in the text,
the sense will be, that the bravest
charged in small compact bodies,
like the Persians at Plataea, while
the rest edged away in rear of
these, or ‘accepted the files’ of the
enemy.

2 pulsos] Some conjecture in-
pulsos or perculsos: but though the
former is more natural, we have

side. The word is, doubssess, nom.

3 Messalla] Who commanded
the Claudian legion, stationed next
to the Galbian, so that in the pur-
suit he may have passed near enough
to see the incident himself.

4 exsanguem] ‘As his life failed
him ;' the tendes gesture came first,
and may have been felt ; his words
could only be heard by the already
departed spirit.

piatos] The original reading of
M., and less obvious and common-
place than placatos.
