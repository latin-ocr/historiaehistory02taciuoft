16 CORNELII TACITI

legatum, et Cassium Longum, praefectum castrorum, duces
deligunt5 sorte oblatos trium Liburnicarum milites, ignaros
et insontes, trucidant 3 relictis castris, abrupto ponte Hostiliam 2
rursus, inde Cremonam pergunt, ut legionibus primae Italicae
et unietvicesimae Rapaci jungerentur, quas Caecina ad obtin-

endam Cremonam cum parte equitum praemiserat.

Ι 5 Ubi haec comperta Antonio, discordes animis, discretos
viribus hostiurn exercitus adgredi statuit, antequam ducibus
auctoritas, militi obsequium et junctis legionibus fiducia rediret.
Namque Fabium Valentem profectum ab urbe adceleraturum- 2
que cognita Caecinae proditione conjectabat ; et fidus Vitellio

Fabius, nec militiae ignarus.

Simul ingens Germanorum vis 3

per Raetiam timebatur 3 et Britannia Galliaque et Hispania
auxilia Vitellius acciverat, inmensam belli luem, ni Antonius,
id ipsum metuens, festinato praelio victoriam praecepisset.
Universo cum exercitu secundis a Verona castris Bedriacum

venit.

made his men take the lead, and
the army gave him the command
as a reward sor his promptitude, or
they took the lead of themselves,

and claimed the nomination to the . . .

command as a reward sor theirs.

milltes] Not the whole crews3
the rowers were at the mercy os the
armed men, even if personally sree-
men.

2 muetvicesimae] This seems to
be the correct spelling os the dat. ;
both elements of unusctvt'cesimus are
regularly declined. For the deriva-
tive adj., Or. usually prints unet-
m’ccsimani, but M.‚ teste ipse, has
in most cases unaetv„ and being
formed from the sem. title of the
legion, this is not impossible. But
the older and better MS. os the
Annals has una-tv. where not mani-
festly corrupt.

praemiserat] ii. 100. 1.

Cn. XV. 1 antequam . . . re-

Postero die, legionibus ad muniendum retentis, 4

turet] Comparing 18. 2, 25. 1, we
see how far his plan succeeded.

2 Namque accounts sor junctis
legionibus as well as for antequam
rediret, sor he naturally sup-
posed that Valens would have come
with the reinsorcements. In spite
of Antonius' haste, he could (40. 2)
have arrived before the battle; he
did come, not only too late, but
almost alone, 41. 1.

fidus vttemo R] So 62. 4. As
such was the fact, Tac. sees that An-
tonius had to allow sor the possibility ;
as sor his being nec militiae tgnarus,
he would know even the fact.

3 bem luem] It is doubtful
whether there is any metaphor of
pestilence really intended ; in Ann.
ii. 47. 3, the word is used os the
destruction caused by an earthquake,
and so here it may mean no more
than ‘ a fatal arrned sorce.'

secundis . . . castus] ‘After two
