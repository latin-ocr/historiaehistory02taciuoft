Altitudo aedibus

Georg. ii. 194, lancibus et pandis
fumantia reddimus exta. Servius in

sulari imperio, 3. 5, and praetor loc. says, reddi dicebantur exta, cum

urbanus, 39. 2 71., even if Vespasian
was still absent? Had he already
started for the German frontier?
Or did his devotion to the Capi-
toline Jove (iii. 74 2) awake later
in lise? Oris it not possible, that
the religious traditionsdeclared that
ls qui l'ractor maximus was the
proper person to do it; and that
praetor was treated in the modern
sense, not the older one in which it
was synonymous with consul, lest
the dictatorship of l). Julius, first
conferred on him by that falsifica-
tion of history, should be dis-
credited? Priscus was os course
older than Domitian, and may have
happened to be the oldest praetor
of the year.

Aenano pontifice] He also per-
haps officiated as the oldest of the
Colit-ge. An inscription commem-
orates him as having commanded a
legion under Tiberius in Germany,
and served in Britain with Claudius.

rectatus] A ritual term, Virg.

probata et elixa (1 Sam. ii. 13-15)
arae superponebantur.

Jovem, Junonem, Minervam]
These three (leities were associated
in the Capitoline Temple: it appears
from coins of the Flavii that more
importance was given to the two
subordinate ones in their restoration
than formerly.

vittas . . . conttgtt] He sym-
bolically ‘laid the stone,'but the real
work of fixing it was done, not by
machinery or by common labourers,
but by enthusiastic volunteers. Dio
tells us that Vespasian's example in
beginning the work encouraged
many nobles to do likewise, and
stimulated the enthusiasm of the
rest: see on § 1.

4 studio laettttaque conum] Cf.
Virg. Aen. ii. 239, funemque manu
contingere gaudent.
