Caesaris mors diremit.

CORNELII TACITI

modicum redactis, Judaeam provinciam equitibus Romanis
aut libertis permisit 3 e quibus Antonius Felix per omnem

saevitiam ac libidinem jus regium servili ingenio exercuit,
Drusilla Cleopatrae et Antonii nepte in matrimonium accepta,
ut ejusdem Antonii Felix progener, Claudius nepos esset.

10 Duravit tamen patientia Judaeis usque ad Gessium Florum

procuratorem: sub eo bellum ortum. Et comprimere coep-

the point, and temporised as sar as
lie sasely could, until Gaius' death
settled the question. We should
remember that Josephus minimises
the really national opposition to
Rome, as distinct from that os a
sanatical party.

5 desumus . . . redactis] The
elder Herod Agrippa died Α. D. 44,
his brother Herod os Chalcis four
years later; his son Agrippa was
allowed a kingdom in the north-
east, but in Judaea proper had only
the honorary rank of a rex sacro-
rum.

equmbus . . . libertis] As pro-
curators z Tacitus omits to mention
that the same had been the case in
Tiberius’ time, from the deposition
of Archelaus to the grant os the
kingdom to Agrippa 1. Felix seems
to have been the only procurator
who was a srecdman: sor the cus-
tom os not appointing men of
higberthan equestrian rank, compare
Agr. 4 1, utrumque avum procura-
torem Caesarum lmbuit, quae eques-
tris nobilitas est.

Antonius Pellx] The brother of
the savourite Pallas, Anu. xii. 54.
Suidas calls him Claudius· Tacitus
is probably right. Suidas, or rather
the authority he followed, knew
that he belong ed to the emperor:
he did not know that Claudius in-
herited him from his mother.

jus reglum servm ingemo] The
tyranny of sreedmen was a recent
scandal at Rome, but one of old

standing in the east: it is un-
necessary, but not impossible, to
suppose that Prov. xix. ιο, xxx. 22,
were applied to Felix by his subjects.

Drusilla] The daughter of Juba
11. by Cleopatra Selene; not the
Drusilla os Acts xxiv. 24, who was
a sister of Agrippa and Berenice:

see Jos. Ant. xx. 7. 2. The name

(the maiden name, so to speak, of

Livia Aug-usta) was almost as com-
mon sor women as Claudius for
men: hence Felix’s marriage with
two Drusillas is not a very extra·
ordinary coincidence. Suetonius
(Claud. 28) calls him trium regina-
rum maritum, but it is not known
who the third was.

ut . . . esset] Perhaps the sense
is rather to mark Felix's outrageous
ambition, ‘ freedman as he was, he
made himself the emperor's own
first cousin by marriage‚’ than to
throw contempt upon Claudius, ‘ he
found himself fii-st cousin to a
rascally sreedman of his own.'

Cri. X. usque ad G. P. procura-
torem] Tacitus probably means to
imp ly that his rule was even mo're
intolerable than that os Felix. Jo-

sephus (xx. 11. 1, B. J. ii. 14. 2) '

charges him with having deliber·
ately goaded the Jews into revolt:

he certainly was guilty of criminal
negligence or cowardiee, in with-

drawing srom the city at the first ·:

outbreak‚ and allowing what might

have been only a riot to become a “

revolution.
