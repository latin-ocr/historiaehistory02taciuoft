Cetera instituta sinistra, foeda, pravitate valuere.

Nam pessimus quisque, spretis religionibus patriis, tributa et 2

stipes illuc gerebant3

unde auctae Judaeorum res, et quia

apud ipsos fides obstinata, misericordia in promptu, sed
adversus omnes alios hostile odium. Separati epulis, discreti 3
cubilibus, projectissima ad libidinem gens, alienarum concu-
bitu abstinent 3 inter se nihil inlicitum. Circumcidere geni· 4

7‚’ septimos numeros being equi-
valent to septimum quemque num-
erum. Halm would prefer septenos
or septenarios ,· the latter, at least,
would be much more natural. For
the notion, connected with the
doctrine of the music of the
spheres, see Cic. deRep. vi. 18. 18,
illi autem octo cursus . . . septem
ffciunt ιίιζςίιιιῑίος mtervallz's sonos,
qui numerus rerum omnium sere
modus est; and compare Plat de
Rep. x. p.617 B. If the institution
of the week has any astronomieal
significance, it is merely the natural
one of an approximate quarter of
the lunar mouth, like the Roman
nundinae. Like the latter, the
weeks among the Orientals got
divorced from the natural and civil
months, though the latter were
never, except in Egypt and Rome,
divorced from each other. The
week was apparently a wide—spread
institution, and its seven <lays were
very early supposed to be connected
with the seven planets; while the
Sabbath was, so far as we know,
exclusively Israelite.

CH. V. quoquo modo inducti]
For Moyses was, according to the
legend, an atheistic charlatan.

sinistra, foeda] Both epithets
to instz'lusa, not to pravitate.

2 pessimus quisque] Among
the Jews themselves, proselytes
bore as bad a name as native
Christians do or (lid among Anglo-
Indians ; perhaps not unjustly,
St. Matt. xxiii. 15. At the same time

Tacitus' taunt, if he means by it
anything more than that they who
abandon their ancestral religion
must be degraded, is capable of
a more honourable interpretation;
Judaism, like Christianity, aster-
wards offered a home to outcasts.
For the frequency of proselytism,
even among Romans, see Hor.
Sat. i. 4]ἱπ., Juv. xiv. 96 sqq&
for the wide prevalence of Jewish
ideas, Hor. Sat. 1. ix. 69 sqq„ Juv.
l. c., Sen. ap. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei,
vi. 1 1, vicli victoribus leges dederunt
(all speaking especially of the
observance of the sabbath).

tributa et stipes] The half-
shekel or δίδραχμον of St. Matt. xvii.
24 sqq. See Cic. pro Flacco, 28.
66-73 Philo, Leg. ad Gaium, 23.
31 ; Jos. Ant. i. 7. 2, where he
speaks of οἱ σεβόμενοι τὸν θέον, as
well as the Jews, paying it.

3 projectissima . . . gens]
Jewish tradition confesses the gross
licentiousness of the generation
before the fall of the city3 see
comm. on Hos. iv. 14, and the ’γενεὰ
πονηρὰ aaz μοιχαλὶς of the Gospels.

inter se 1111111 inlicitum] It is
possible that Tacitus had seen
instances where the scandalous
doctrine was acted on, that the

‘new birth' of a proselyte cancelled
all natural relationsliipS‚ and so
removed all bars of kindred to
intermarriage3 it is also possible
that he was shocked at the inter—
marriages of uncle and niece‚ which
were common in the Herodian
