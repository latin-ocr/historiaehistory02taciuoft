28 CORNELII TACITI

neque volnera morabantur, quin subruerent vallum quaterent·
que portas, innixi humeris et super iteratam testudinem scan-
Integri cum 3
sauciis, semineces cum exspirantibus volvuntur, varia pereun-
29 tium forma et omni imagine mortium. Acerrimum tertiae
septimaeque legionum certamen; et dux Antonius cum
delectis auxiliaribus eodem incubuerat. Obstinatos inter se 2
cum sustinere Vitelliani nequirent et superjacta tela testudine
laberentur, ipsam postremo ballistam in subeuntes propulere,
quae ut ad praesens disjecit obruitque quos inciderat, ita
Simul juncta turris 3
Qua septimani dum nituntur cuneis,
tertianus securibus gladiisque portam perfregit. Primum
inrupisse G. Volusium tertiae legionis militem inter omnes
Is in vallum egressus, deturbatis qui 4
restiterant, conspicuus manu ac voce, capta castra conclamavit.

dentes prensarent hostium tela brachiaque.

pinnas ac summa valli ruina sua traxit.
ictibus saxorum cessit.

auctores con Stat.

aster a double neque coupling two
distinct subjects, ag. D. Brutus,
ap. Cic. ad Fam. xi. 20. Ifin.

3 volvuntur] ‘Roll on ;’ the
testudo is formed a second time,
and the wounded and dying from
the former one forced along in its
advance; it does not appear that it
was thrown down a second time till
the ballista was thrown on them.

omm tmagtne mox-uum] Com-
pare the Virgilian plurima mortis
imago, Aen. ii. 369.

Cn. XXIX. 1 tertiae . . . cer-
tamen] ‘The rivalry between the
3d and (Galba's) 7th,’ which were
engaged in the same attack‚ 27. 2,
hence eodem.

2 Obsttnatos mter se] Resolute
neither to yield to the other.

quos inciderat] Α most unusual
constr„ though two instances are
quoted from Appuleius. Perhaps
the case is determined by the pre-
sence os the two transitive verbs,
so that it is virtually an instance of
attraction ; or Tac. may have taken

the accus. while dropping the prep.
from the passage of virgil which it
is evident he had in his head3 Aen.
ii. 463 sqq.—
(Turrim . . .) qua summa labantis
Juncturas tabulata dabant, convelli-
mus altis
Sedibus inpulimusque ,· ea lapsa repente
rulnam
Cum sonitu trahit, et Danaum super
agmina late
Incidit.

See also Aen. ix. 530-562.

3 juncta turris] The foundation
of the tower—the place where it
fitted on to the earthen rampart.

gladsssque] In spite of 20. 4
Os course the gate os the camp was
not as massive as that of the city
walls (30. 1). It seems far-setched
to reconcile this passage with that
in c. 20, by supposing that the
secures were employed on the gate,
the gladii only on the desenders.

4 conclamavit] The use of this
word sor the loud shout of one man,
though generally, is not exclusively,
