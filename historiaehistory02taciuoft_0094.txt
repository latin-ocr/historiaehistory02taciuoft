82 CORNELII TACITI HISTOR.

tudine munerum. non constantia morum contineri putat,
meruit magis quam habuit. Reipublicae haud dubie intererat 4
Vitellium vinci : sed imputare perfidiam non possunt, qui
Vitellium Vespasiano prodidere, cum a Galba descivissent.

Praecipiti in occasum die, ob pavorem magistratuum sena· ς
torumque, qui dilapsi ex urbe aut per domos clientium semet
occultabant, vocari senatus non potuit. Domitianum, post-
quam nihil hostile metuebatur, ad duces partium progressum
et Caesarem consalutatum, miles frequens, utque erat in armis,

generously, whether they desewed
it or no: see on ii. 100. 1.

contineri] M. has amanen-‚s in
no Latin writer but Tacitus could
continere putat mean ‘thinks to re-
tain‚‘ and it is unlikely, if not quite
impossible, that it should be so
used by him.

mermt] ‘Earned' perhaps ex·
presses the meaning more accurately
than ‘deserved ;' it is however
going too far to translate ⁴ paid sor,’
like Bumouf and others, approved
by Or. Or.’s reference to ii. 92. 3

blame Vitellius‘ treacherous friends
:ggllleast as much as Vitellius him·

4 vespasiano . . . nomba] Cf.
7. 3. Tac. thinks the government

os both Galba and Vespasian to ⁷

have been tolerable, though not im· ·
maculate. Both had at any rate
the same saults, ii. 95. 6 fin.

5 Praecipiti . . . mo] Cf. Virg.
Aen. ii. 8. 9, Nox umida caelo Prae-
cipilat ; still closer is Cic. de Or. iii.
55. 209, Sol . . . ipse jam procapi-
taus mc quoque haec praoetjpstem

is to the point, but Tac. means to paene wolva-re coegit.
