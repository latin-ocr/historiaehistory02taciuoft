that we cannot say whether his
connection was with the Junii Bruti
or the Junii Silani; for the dread
felt for the latter, see Ann. xiii. 1.
2, xv. 35. 1.

stirpe imperatoria] Perhaps the
allusion is rather to his father (?)
having been the last non-imperial
imperator (Amz. iii. 74. 617), than
to the descent from Antonius above
mentioned. But at any rate he is
charged asa pretenderto sovereignty,
not as a republican.

amicorum inimicorumque negle-
gens] Heedless who were his friends
or enemies.

6, 7 labores] ‘ Sufferings,'some-
thing of a euphemism for a danger-
ous illness. Si quid fato accedat
seems to have been considered a
euphemism also; Nero is made
to use a still plainer phrase in Anu.
xiv. 47. 1, si quid salo pateretur,
speaking, as here, of a possible
successor.

Cu. XXXIX. 1 inter soelus
metumque] ‘Between (horror at)
the crime, and sear (of Blaesus).'
Lucius was capable of planning a
wilfal murder, Aulus was not,
though unseeling at a death sup-
posed to serve his interest.

ne dnata] This, with the maestam

Blaeso, super claritatem natalium et elegam-3

et funebrem noctem os the last c.‚
seems to imply that Blaesus was to
be poisoned that very night, and if
so, it is hard to see how Vitellius,
himself seriously if not dangerously
ill, managed to visit him. If Lipsius
is right in identifying this story with
one in Suetonius (ls'jt. 14) ofa man
whom Vitellius poisoned with his
own hands, the difficultyis increased,
and that story, if admitted in full,
only comes to this—that a maii with
a sever asked for cold water, that
Vitellius gave it him, and the man
died. Tac. appears to believe that
Blaesus was really poisoned, and
we cannot judge whether the evi-
dence justified the belief, but the
sic accepimus of 38. 1 is meant to
guard against his being held re-
sponsible for all the details.

2 Addidit faenori fidem] The
proof that he kfiied him mis, that
he went to see him when dying,
and seemed to take a brutal pleasure
in the sight.

nomn] In the etymological sense,
‘ easy to discet-n.⁹

ipsa emm verba referam] They
seem then ιο have been less pro-
verbial in Latin than in English,
but are used by Cic. Verr. ii. 5.
26. 65.
