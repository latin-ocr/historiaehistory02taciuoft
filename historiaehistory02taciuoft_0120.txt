Cir. XXVI. 1111 caelo] In the
south there would have been nothing
wonderful in even so large a river
getting perceptibly low in autumn.
lt was now probably September or
October (31. 1, iii. 22. 1).

eademque de causa] 'she troops
were crowded on the Rhine, and
could not get provisions up the
Rhine, which appears from the next
c. to have been the only mode of
carriage. Of course they are not
likely, even in time os peace, to
have derived their supplies from
(κνοω the Rhine.

2 vetera 1mp. munimenta] The
amnes themselves. So Germ. 29. 3,
ultra lx'ltcnum ultraque veteres ler-
minos imperii.

fors . . . fatum] Notice the an-
tithesis between the two.

3 sexta decuma] The figures in

Ibi struenda acie, muniendo vallandoque, et
ceteris belli meditamentis, militem firmabant.

M. are obscure, whence some read
tertia decuma. But the ¹6th was in
Germany (i. 55. 2), the 13th not
(iii. 41, etc.)

Gallus] Who could not be sus-
pected of complicity in the alleged
treason of Flaccus, as he had already
been its victim.

struenda ame] ‘ Drill,' in the
modern sense, which formed a
Sinaller part than we should have
expected in the exercises os the Ro-
man soldier ; from Polybius’ elabor-
ate account it is plain that it was the
care bestowed muniendo vallandoque
that was their most conspicuous dis-
tinction from other armies. We are
probably to understand that these
troops were so much disorganised
that they had to go back to exercises
that ordinarily were got over as the
first lessons of a recruit.
