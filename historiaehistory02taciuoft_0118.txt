CORNELII TACITI

cognito castrorum obsidio, et missis per Gallias qui auxilia
concirent, lectos e legionibus Dillio Voculae, duoetvicesimae

legionis legato, tradit, ut quarn maximis per ripam itineribus

celeraret, ipse navibus, invalidus corpore, invisus militibus.
Neque enim ambigue fremebant, ‘emissas a Mogontiacoz
Batavorum cohortes, dissimulatos Civilis conatus, adsciri in

societatem Germanos.

Non Primi Antonii neque Muciani
ope Vespasianum magis adolevisse.

Aperta odia armaque 3

palam depelli: fraudem et dolum obscura, eoque inevitabilia.
Civilem stare contra, struere aciem: Hordeonium e cubiculo

et lectulo jubere quidquid hosti conducat.

Tot armatas

fortissimorum virorum manus unius senis valetudine regi.
Quin potius, interfecto traditore, fortunam virtutemque suam

malo omine exsolverent. ’

His inter se vocibus instinctos4 .

flammavere insuper adlatae a Vespasiano literae, quas Flaccus,
quia occultari nequibant, pro contione recitavit, vinctosque

25 qui attulerant ad Vitellium misit.
Bonnam, hiberna primae legionis, ventum.

Sic mitigatis animis,
Infensior illic

miles culpam cladis in Hordeonium vertebat: ‘ejus jussu

directam adversus Batavos aciem, tamquam a Mogontiaco

in the next ξ he uses ardentes hastae
rather than salaricae.

CH. JXIV. unoetvicesimae] See
on ι. 1 . 4.

navibus] Probably having on
board the legionarios not included
in the picked soree os Vocula, though
he would no doubt have one to him-
self and his staff. For infensus mili-
tibus εις well as invalidus corpore
(sor which see i. 9. 1) are meant
to account sor his going by the river.
The conjecture pavidus sor navibus
is at least as gratuitous as ingenious

2 dissimulatos c. conatus] 18. 1.

3 e cubiculo . . . contiueat] The
charge of treason and that os physi-
cal incompetence are lumped up
together, not without dramatic pro-
priety. But it more or less dawns

on the soldiers that lameness was
rather an excuse than an aggrava-
tion of incompetence, so they say
that even that excuse is unreason-
able (lot . . . regi).

traditore] The only place where
the word occurs in good Latin, its
occurrence in derived languages
having apparently arisen from the
ecclesiastical sense of persons who
surrendered the Scriptures in per-
secution. Probably here it is not
really synonymous with proditor ,⁰
Flaccus had handed over the Bata·
vian troops to Civilis, whether it
was true or no that he moent to
hetray the Roman troops to him.

maio omine] Bad luck was to be
expected aster a bad beginning.
