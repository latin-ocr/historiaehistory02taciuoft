168 CORNELII TACITI

primoribus Aegyptiorum nomine Basiliden, quem procul
Alexandria plurium dierum itinere et aegro corpore detineri
haud ignorabat. Percunctatur sacerdotes num illo die Basi— 3
lides templum inisset ς percunctatur obvios num in urbe visus
sit: denique, missis equitibus, explorat illo temporis momento

octoginta milibus passuum afuisse. Tunc divinam speciem

⁸ et vim responsi ex nomine Basilidis interpretatus est. Origo

dei nondum nostris auctoribus celebrata: Aegyptiorum antis-
tites sic memorant ς Ptolemaeo regi, qui Macedonum primus
Aegypti opes firmavit. cum Alexandriae recens conditae
moenia templaque et religiones adderet, oblatum per quietem
decore eximio et majore quam humana specie juvenem, qui
moneret ut, fidissimis amicorum in Pontum missis, effigiem
suam acciret: laetum id regno, magnamque et inclutam

Basilides being well known in
Egypt, it would be easy to dress up
a double or a puppet to represent
him, to be shown to Vespasian
either bodily or by a combination
os mirrors. At the same time, we
should remember that the wraiths
os sick (generally, but not always,
dying) persons are the most frequent
and best attested class of ‘super-
natural’ apparitions. And Ves-
pasian was in the srame of mind
most favourable to seeing visions.

e prtmortbus Aeg] Suetonius
says he was a freedman os Ves-
pasian’s own.

Basfflden] Plainly a disserent
person from the Carmelite priest‚
ii. 78. 6; nevertheless the recollec-
tion of his name may have played
some part in suggesting the vision,

if we suppose it to have been sub-
1(κζὲῃζῐῗιοιικε . . . mterpretavus est]

A zeugma, the verb being used in
somewhat different senses in the two

clauses, the more proper in the
latter; ‘he inser-red the vision to

be supernatural, and traced the
oracle’s meaning in the derivation

of the man's name, ’-that Basilides
promised him the βασιλεία.

ΕΗ. LXXXIII. ongo . . .
memorant] We have a similar
quasi-Herodotean excursus on the
Paphian Venus, ii. 3. Serapis was,
as appears srorn inscriptions, already
a popular object of worship at
Rome. Or. supposes that Tacitus
wished to prove that he was a
tolerably respectable one.

Ptolemaeo reg-l, qul . . . primus
. . . firmavit] Tacitus felt that it
would be a great convenience to
distinguish the homonymous kings
of the Egyptian and Syrian dynasties
in modern sashion‚ as ‘Ptolemy 1.’
and ‘ Ptolemy 111.,' instead of the
epithets Soter and Euergetes, which
he hardly knew whether to trans-
late or to reproduce as proper
names. Here he introduces the
word primus, while paraphrasing
§Mem in 84. 6 he paraphrastically
introduces the numeral without the
title. Josephus does write Πτολε-
μαῖον τὸν ἕκτον, B. J i. 1 init.

111 Pontum] According to Plu-
tarch (de Is. et Os. c. 28), he named
no place: Ptolemy had to inquire
