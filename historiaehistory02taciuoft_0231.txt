HISTORIARUM FRAGMENTA.

παραχρῆμα διὰ τὸ δεισιδαιμονῆσαι
ἐσέδραμον, ἀλλ’ ὀψέ ποτε, τοῦ Τίτου
σφᾶς καταναγκάσαντος, εἴσω προεχώ-
ρησαν. Moreover, Josephus (B. J.
vi. 2. 3) charges the zealots with
gross profanation of the holy places
which they occupied—*7025 δ’ ἁγίοις
καὶ ἀβάτοις μετὰ τῶν ὅπλων εἰσε-
πήδων, θερμὰς ἔτι τὰς χεῖρας ἐξ
ὁμοφύλων ἔχοντες <pomum—while
Dio's authority gave the sublime
picture of disciplined devotion—-
ὥσπερ τι ἕρμαιον τὸ πρός τε τῷ ναῷ
καὶ ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ μαχόμενοι πεσεῖν
εὑρηκότες, ἠμύνοντο, ὁ μὲν δῆμος
κάτω ἐν τῷ προνάῳ, οἱ δὲ βουλευταὶ ἐν
τοῖς ἀναβασμοῖς, οἵ θ’ ἱερεῖς ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ
μεγάρῳ τεταγμένοι-αηεί says they
fought against the superior numbers
till the temple itself was in flames.

nonnullis] Bernays points to
ii. 31-3, 82. 4, 5, iii. 1-4 (we may
add iv. 76), as showing that Taci-
tus' general practice is to name the
advocate of each sententia in a
council of war.

ultra omnia. mortalia illustrem]
A hyperbole which of course can-
not be assigned to Tacitus, while

217

some similar clause improves the
rhythm of the sentence.

modestiae] Cf. Ann. i. 9. 6 sor
the Tacitean use os this word in the
sense of ‘ moderation.'

alii] The same remark applies
as on nonnullis, though with per-
haps less force.

Christianorum proves the early
date when the passage was written ;
after the time of Hadrian no one
would have conceived Judaism and
Christianity as so related that the
second would fall with the first,
while the view here taken of them
is not unlike that of Ann. xv. 44. 4.
It is almost strange that, writing
after Julian had attempted to
damage Christianity by re-establish-
ing Judaism, Severus should repro-
duce so faithfully the point of view
of a pagan of an earlier period.

reug-io] Post-Classical, in the
sense of a definite creed.

accensis omnium animis] In-
cluded by Bernays in his extract
from Sulpicius, perhaps as suggest-
ing that these three (or five) words
may also come from Tacitus.

3. Ut verbis Cornelii Taciti utar, Sene Augusto Janus
patefactus, dum apud extremos terrarum terminos novae
gentes saepe ex usu et aliquando cum damno quaeruntur,
usque ad Vespasiani duravit imperium—ORosms, vii. 3.

The only instance in which we have a fragment of the lost books of
Tacitus prosessedly quoted with textual accuracy. That this is so there
is no reason to doubt. The passage probably occurred in the account of
Vespasian’s closing the temple after the completion οἱ the Jewish war.

Sene Aug-usto] Augustus had
closed it three times in (and there-
fore opened it twice between) the
years 13.c. 29, 25, and 10. He
reopened it for the last time per·
haps in A.D. 1, when the German
wars were renewed.

duravit] Nero had taken upon

him to close it in Α. D. 63 (referred
to, Amz. xvi. 28. 5); but we find
that there were objections raised to
the legitimacy of the closing, and
no doubt after his death the act was
set aside, and the official records of
it caneelled.
