“Whatever may be thought of uhi> work :is compared with previous editions, 'the
editor ventures to claim sor it the merit os greater simplicity of arrangement. The foot-
ποῖος, which have been reserved mainly sor explanations os technical words, are sewen*
and less crowded with matter: the familiar finger-posts exist no longer: the subdedis-
tinction between numerals above the line with a curve and those without a curve has
been abandoned ; while τι glauce at the Table os Contents will show that a definite plan
hm been followed in the order of the Exercises¹ the object being to keep in view the
stem-formation os words. '

been made throughout to the ⁴ Public School Latin Primer,’ the p raseolo ⁴01· which
is generally adopted z the formation os words from the Stem is taught from e first: the ⁸
constructions os the (lases and os the verb-Noun are sully treated: the Exercises have
been almost entirely re-written, and arc longer: anecdotos. sables‚ ἀι, have been in-
serted into the passage> sor translation into English: some fifty test Exercises have been
added: and lamly, a (ie-nera! Index has been caresully compiled, by which the search sor ,,
